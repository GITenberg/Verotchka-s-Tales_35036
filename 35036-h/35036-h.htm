Verotchka's
one little eye is sleeping, the

my pretty one, and father will tell you
these stories. I think they are all here.
The Siberian cat, Vasca; the shaggy village
dog, Postoika; the gray mousie-gnawers;
the cricket behind the stove; the iridescent
starling in the cage; and the cock,
the bully.</p>

The full moon in the heaven looks into
the window. The cock-eyed rabbit hops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
on his haunches and the wolf's eyes flash
yellow fire lights. The bear, Mishka, is
sucking his paw, and the old sparrow flies
up to the window, pecks the pane with his
bill, and asks, "How soon, now?"</p>

<p>I think they're all here now, waiting for
Verotchka's Tale.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A BOLD RABBIT WITH
COCK EYES AND A SHORT TAIL</h2>


<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t1"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HIS rabbit
was born in the woods and was scared of
everything. If a branch
cracked anywhere or a bird
flew past or a lump of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4]</a></span>
fell from a tree, his rabbit heart went
down, down, down into his furry boots.
Now this little rabbit was afraid for a day,
for two days, for a week, for a whole year.
But when he was grown up, he just got
tired of being a scared rabbit.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of anybody!" he
shouted through the woods. "I am not
afraid at all! I am not afraid of anything
or of anybody, and that's all there is to it!"</p>

<p>One day, the rabbits gathered to listen
to him. The little ones ran, the old rabbits
hobbled along to hear Long-Ear, Cock-Eye,
Short-Tail's boastings.</p>

<p>They listened and couldn't believe their
own ears, for there never had been anything
like a rabbit, unafraid of anything
or anybody before.</p>

<p>"Oh, you Cock-Eye," called one, "do
you mean to say you aren't even afraid of
a wolf?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not even a wolf, nor a fox, nor a bear.
I am afraid of no one," said Cock-Eye.</p>

<p>Now this was altogether too amusing.
The little rabbits giggled, covering their
faces with their front paws. The kind old
mother rabbits laughed and even the wise
old rabbits, who had had a taste of the
paws of the fox, and had felt the fangs of
the wolf, smiled. So very funny was this
rabbit that suddenly everyone was seized
with merriment. They started jumping,
tumbling, turning somersaults, and playing
tag as if they had all suddenly gone
mad.</p>

<p>"What is the use of talking so much,"
finally shouted Cock-Eye, drunk with his
own boldness. "I tell you if I were to
meet a wolf, I'd eat him up myself."</p>

<p>"My, what a funny rabbit!" said the
crowd. "And what a foolish rabbit, too."
They all knew he was funny and foolish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6]</a></span>
still they laughed at him and jested with
him about the wolf. And as they were
speaking of the wolf, the wolf stood right
there listening, though they did not see
him.</p>

<p>The wolf was walking through the
forest on his own wolfish business. Then
he grew hungry and began to think how
fine it would be to have a bit of fresh rabbit.
Suddenly quite near by, he heard
rabbits talking, laughing and shouting his
name. He stopped short, sniffed the air
and crept nearer and nearer. When he
was very near the merry-making rabbits,
he learned that they were making sport
of him, and that Cock-Eye, Long-Ear,
Short-Tail was laughing at him more than
anyone else.</p>

<p>"Eh, Brother! Just wait and I'll gobble
you up," said the Gray Wolf to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7]</a></span>
as he tried to spy out the boastful, bold
rabbit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rabbits, aware of nothing,
made merry and merrier. Finally,
the boaster climbed up on the stump of a
tree, sat on his hind legs, and said,</p>

<p>"Hear, all ye cowards! Listen and look
at me! Now I will show you some tricks.
I ... I ... I...."</p>

<p>The words were frozen on his lips, for
just then he saw the wolf looking, looking
straight at him. The other rabbits did not
see the wolf, but Cock-Eye did and he
didn't dare to breathe.</p>

<p>Then happened the most extraordinary
thing. Through sheer fear, the Boaster
jumped up like a rubber ball, fell on the
wide forehead of the wolf, rolled over his
back, turned a somersault in the air,
landed on his feet, and ran as if he were
trying to run out of his skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Long, long did the unfortunate rabbit
run. It seemed to him the wolf was right
behind him and that in another moment
he would feel the wolf's fangs. The poor
limp rabbit ran on until he had no
strength left and finally he closed his eyes
and fell under a bush, dead with weariness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wolf was running in
another direction. When the rabbit fell
on his forehead, the wolf thought he had
been hit by a gun shot and he ran away as
fast as he could, saying to himself, "There
are plenty of other rabbits in the forest.

not fit to eat."</p>

<p>Now for a long time the other rabbits
did not realize what had happened. Some
ran into the bushes, some hid behind
stumps, others crawled into their holes.
After a while they grew tired of hiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11]</a></span>
and little by little, they crept out and
looked around.</p>

<p>Then said one, "Our rabbit certainly
scared that wolf. If it had not been for
him, few of us would have escaped alive.
But where is he, our Fearless One?"</p>

<p>And everyone began looking for him.
They looked everywhere, but Cock-Eye
was nowhere to be found. They began to
think the Gray Wolf had eaten him up,
when they discovered him, lying in a hole
under a bush, almost dead from fear.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Cock-Eye," shouted the
rabbits all in one voice. "You certainly
frightened that wolf very cleverly. We
thought you were boasting all the time,
when you were telling us you were not
afraid of anything or anybody."</p>

<p>At once the bold rabbit came to life.
He crept out of the hole, shook himself,
squinted his eyes, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what did you think, you cowards?"</p>

<p>And from that day, the bold rabbit was
convinced that he was really not afraid of
anyone.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF LITTLE CACINELLA</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-h1"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>OW and where little Cacinella
was born, no one knows. It
happened one sunny day
in spring. Little Cacinella
looked around and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14]</a></span>
"Very nice." She stretched her tiny
wings, rubbed one little thin leg against
the other, looked around again and said:</p>

<p>"How very, very nice! How warm the
sun! How blue the sky! How green the
grass! How very, very nice! and all this
is mine!"</p>

<p>Rubbing one little leg against the other
once more, little Cacinella began to fly.
She flew and looked around and rejoiced.
Beneath her, the grass was green, and hidden
in its bosom, was a crimson flower.</p>

<p>"Little Cacinella, come to me," called
the flower.</p>

<p>Cacinella came down to the ground,
climbed into the flower and sipped its
sweet nectar.</p>

<p>"How kind you are, little flower," said
Cacinella, rubbing her mouth with one of
her little thin legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I may be kind, but I cannot walk,"
complained the flower.</p>

<p>"Still, the world is lovely," said little
Cacinella, "and it is all mine, too."</p>

<p>She had hardly finished, when a hairy
drone flew down upon the flower with a
loud buzz.</p>

<p>"Buzz! Buzz! Who dares to get into
my flower? Buzz! Buzz! Who dares
to sip my sweet nectar? Buzz! Buzz!
Oh, you nasty little Cacinella, get away
from here! Buzz! Buzz! Get away
or I'll sting you to death."</p>

<p>"I say, what does this mean?" piped
little Cacinella. "Everything is mine."</p>

<p>"Buzz! Buzz! No, it's mine."</p>

<p>Little Cacinella was barely able to
escape from the angry drone. She crept
into the grass, licked her thin little legs,
sticky with flower nectar, and said angrily:</p>

<p>"How rude that drone was! It's quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16]</a></span>
amazing! He even tried to sting me to
death! Why, aren't they all mine, the sun
and the grass and the flower!"</p>

<p>"No, pardon me. They are all mine,"
said a fuzzy Caterpillar, crawling along a
blade of grass. Little Cacinella realized
that a caterpillar cannot fly, so she grew
bold.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Caterpillar. You are
mistaken. I do not interfere with your
crawling. Don't argue with me."</p>

<p>"Very well. Pray don't touch my
grass. To tell you the truth, I don't like
it. So many of you fly about here. You
are all such light-minded creatures; while
I, Caterpillar, am a serious person. To be
frank, everything is mine. I crawl along
a blade of grass and I eat it up. I get into
a flower and I eat that up. Good day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-i1"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>N a few hours, little Cacinella
learned many things. She learned
that besides the sun, the blue sky
and the green grass, there are
angry drones, serious caterpillars,
thorns on flowers&mdash;all of which made
one sad. Little Cacinella had thought
that everything belonged to her and was
especially created for her. Now it hurt
her to discover that others thought that
everything had been made especially for
them. Something was wrong.</p>

<p>Little Cacinella flew further and she
came to a pool.</p>

<p>"Now, this is surely mine," she piped
gaily. "My water. I am so happy.
Here are also grass and flowers."</p>

<p>Then she met other cacinellas.</p>

<p>"Hello, sister," they called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, dears. I'm so glad I met you.
It was getting very lonely flying about
alone. What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"We are playing, sister. Come along
with us. We are very happy. When were
you born?"</p>

<p>"Just to-day. A drone almost stung me
to death and I also met a caterpillar. I
thought everything belonged to me. They
said everything was theirs."</p>

<p>The little cacinellas calmed their guest
and invited her to play with them. Then
they swarmed in a thick cloud over the
pool, playing tag, flying and squeaking.</p>

<p>Our little Cacinella was almost overcome
with joy and completely forgot the
angry drone and the serious caterpillar.</p>

<p>"Oh how nice," she gurgled with delight.
"It's all mine&mdash;the sun, the grass,
the water. I cannot understand why the
others were so angry. It is all mine, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21]</a></span>
don't interfere with anybody's life. I let
them fly and buzz and be happy. It
doesn't bother me."</p>

<p>Little Cacinella played a while and
then sat down for a rest among some reeds.
Sitting there, little Cacinella watched the
other cacinellas playing, when suddenly a
sparrow flashed by, no one knew whence,
and dropped like a stone among them.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the little cacinellas,
scattering in all directions.</p>

<p>When the sparrow flew away, many
little cacinellas were missing from the
flock.</p>

<p>"The thief," scolded the older cacinellas.
"He ate about fifteen or more of us."</p>

<p>"That's worse than the drone," thought
little Cacinella, and growing frightened,
she hid with the other cacinellas deeper
among the reeds. But there too, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22]</a></span>
found enemies. Two of them were eaten
by a small fish and two more by a frog.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" wondered little Cacinella.
"This is not a bit nice. It is almost
impossible to live. They are perfectly
horrid!"</p>

<p>It was a good thing that there were
many little cacinellas. Those that disappeared
were hardly missed; many new
ones were always coming, flying about
and squeaking, "It's all ours! It's all
ours!"</p>

<p>"No, it's not," called our little Cacinella
to them. "There are, besides us, angry
drones, serious caterpillars, horrid sparrows,
fishes and frogs. Take care, sisters!
Take care!"</p>

<p>When night came, all the little cacinellas
hid in the rushes. Stars sprinkled
the sky. The moon rose and reflected
everything in the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"My moon, my stars," thought little
Cacinella; but she did not dare to say it
aloud. Some one might take them away
from her.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-s1"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>UMMER passed quickly for
little Cacinella. There was so
much to make her happy, but
there were sad times, too. Twice
she was almost swallowed by a
swift marten. Once a frog crept up to her
unawares and nearly gobbled her up. A
little cacinella has many enemies, you
know.</p>

<p>Our little Cacinella had her own joys.
One day, she met another little Cacinella
with long hairy moustache, who said:</p>

<p>"You are so pretty, little Cacinella. Let
us be friends and live together."</p>

<p>And they did. And they were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24]</a></span>
happy. They were always together;
wherever one went, the other followed.</p>

<p>Summer passed before they were aware
of it.</p>

<p>Rainy days came; nights grew cold.
Our little Cacinella laid many eggs. She
hid them in the thick grass, murmuring,
"How tired I am."</p>

<p>No one saw how or when little Cacinella
died. She may not have died at all.
She may have only fallen asleep quietly
for the winter, to wake up in the spring
and be happy once more.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF MOSQUITO LONG-NOSE
AND FUZZY BEAR, MISHKA SHORT-TAIL</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-i2"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>T happened at noon, when all the
mosquitoes hid in the marsh to
escape the heat.</p>

<p>Mr. Long-Nose settled under a
leaf and fell asleep. His sleep was
disturbed by a despairing shout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wow! Wow! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Mosquito Long-Nose jumped out from
under the leaf and called:</p>

<p>"What happened? Why are you
screaming?"</p>

<p>A whole swarm of mosquitoes flew
about, buzzed and shrieked&mdash;apparently
for no reason at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! Just think what happened!
A bear came into our marsh, stretched
himself out full length and fell asleep.
And as he lay down, he crushed five hundred
of us; and as he opened his mouth,
he swallowed a hundred of us. Some
trouble, brothers. We hardly escaped being
crushed to death ourselves."</p>

<p>Mosquito Long-Nose grew furiously
angry&mdash;angry at the bear and at the
foolish mosquitoes, who were shouting to
no purpose.</p>

<p>"Stop your squealing!" shouted he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27]</a></span>
"It's all very simple. I will go and chase
the bear away. Your noise is foolish."</p>

<p>Mosquito Long-Nose grew even more
angry and flew away. He reached the
marsh and there lay the bear in the very
thickets where the mosquitoes had lived
from the beginning of time.</p>

<p>The Bear lay stretched full length,
snoring and whistling like a trumpeter.</p>

<p>"The beast! Grabbed the place that
doesn't belong to him ... killed off
so many mosquitoes ... and now he
sleeps so soundly! It's outrageous!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Uncle, what are you doing?"
shouted Mosquito Long-Nose through
the forest. He shouted so loudly that he
grew afraid of himself. Fuzzy Mishka
opened one eye and saw nothing. Then
he opened the other eye and all he could
see was a mosquito hovering over his nose.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Comrade?" grumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28]</a></span>
Mishka, getting angry, and justly so.
There he was all ready for a nap when
along comes this good-for-nothing squealing
at him and waking him up.</p>

<p>"Hey, Uncle, get away! Get up and go
away in a friendly fashion!" advised
Long-Nose.</p>

<p>Mishka opened his eyes, looked at Mr.
Impudence, snorted and grew furiously
angry.</p>

<p>"What do you want, you good-for-nothing?"
growled Mishka.</p>

<p>"Leave our quarters or I'll eat you up,
fur coat and all."</p>

<p>The bear was very much amused. He
turned over on the other side, covered his
face with his paw and fell asleep, snoring
immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-m1"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>OSQUITO Long-nose returned
to the flock, shouting
across the entire marsh, "I
certainly did frighten him!
He will never come again."</p>

<p>The mosquitoes wondered. They were
perplexed and asked, "But what about
Mishka? Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, brothers. He surely got
scared when I told him I'd eat him up, if
he did not go away. You know I don't
like to jest, so I just said, 'I'll eat you up,'
I'm afraid he perished from fear while I
was coming back here. Well, it's his own
fault."</p>

<p>The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. They
were discussing how to deal with an invading
bear. There never had been such
a noise in the marsh before. They buzzed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30]</a></span>
and hissed and finally decided to chase the
bear away from their domain.</p>

<p>"Let him go home into his forest and
sleep there. The marsh is ours. Our
fathers and our grandfathers lived in this
very marsh. It is ours."</p>

<p>One sensible old mosquito advised them
to leave the bear alone. "Let him have his
sleep," said she, "when he wakes up, he
will leave the marsh of his own accord."</p>

<p>But the rest of the flock just flew at her.
The poor old thing was glad to get away
and hide.</p>

<p>"Come on, brothers!" shouted Mosquito
Long-Nose, louder than the rest.
"We will show him who we are!"</p>

<p>The whole flock followed Mosquito
Long-Nose. They came to the spot where
Mishka was lying as still as death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31]</a></span></p>
<p>"Didn't I say he died of fright?"
boasted Mosquito Long-Nose. "It's a
pity! He was a fine, strong bear!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_039bearrunning.png" width="400" height="556" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brothers, he is only asleep," piped a
tiny mosquito, flying close to Mishka's
nose and being almost blown to pieces by
the wind from the bear's nostrils.</p>

<p>"The shameless rascal!" squealed the
Mosquitoes in chorus. "He crushed five
hundred of us ... swallowed another
hundred ... and now he sleeps as if
nothing had happened."</p>

<p>But shaggy Mishka slept soundly as if
nothing had really happened. He was
whistling through his nose.</p>

<p>"He is pretending to be asleep," said
Mosquito Long-Nose. "I'll show him
who I am. Hey, Uncle, enough of this
make-believe!"</p>

<p>And with this, Mosquito Long-Nose
flew at the bear, aimed at his black nose
and pierced it with his mosquito-sting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34]</a></span>
Mishka fairly jumped, grabbing his nose
with his paw; but Mosquito Long-Nose
was already too far away.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle, you did not seem to like
that," squealed Mosquito Long-Nose.
"Go away or it will be the worse for you.
I'm not alone. With me, is Grandfather,
Mosquito Longer-Nose, and my younger
brother, Mosquito Longest-Nose. Better
go away, Uncle."</p>

<p>"I will not go away!" shouted the bear,
sitting down on his haunches. "I'll crush
you all to death!"</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, you're boasting foolishly."</p>

<p>Once more, Mosquito Long-Nose flew
at the bear and this time he aimed at his
eye. Mishka groaned with pain, and slapped
his paw over his face, trying to catch
the mosquito. Again he failed and he
only scratched his face in the effort.
Mosquito Long-Nose was meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35]</a></span>
buzzing by close to his ear and threatening
Mishka, "I'll eat you up, Uncle."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-m2"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>ISHKA grew angry and
angrier. He grabbed a birch
tree and tore it up by the roots,
aiming it at the mosquitoes.
He waved it and waved it until
he grew very tired, but he did not succeed
in killing a single mosquito. They
just swarmed and buzzed a little beyond
his reach. Then Mishka took a huge
stone and hurled it at the Mosquitoes, but
all in vain.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle," squealed Mosquito
Long-Nose, "I'll eat you up after all."</p>

<p>The battle raged between Mishka and
the mosquitoes. There was much noise;
one could hear the bear's growling from
afar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-h2"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>E tore up many trees, he dug
up many stones. He always
aimed at Mosquito Long-Nose,
who seemed to be right
over his ear. But the bear's
paw always missed its aim, while his face
was scratched and bleeding from his own
claws.</p>

<p>Finally, Mishka was overpowered. He
sat on his haunches and snorted and
thought of a new trick, which was to roll
in the grass and crush the whole mosquito
kingdom. Mishka rolled and rolled but
nothing happened. He only grew more
tired. Then he hid his face in the moss,
but that was even worse because the mosquitoes
clung to his bear tail. Mishka
became furious.</p>

<p>"Just wait, I'll show you!" he howled so
loudly that he could be heard for miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37]</a></span>
around. "I'll show you some trick! Aiy!
Aiy! Aiy!"</p>

<p>The mosquitoes flew aside and waited to
see what would happen. Now Mishka
climbed a tree like an acrobat, sat on the
thickest bough and roared:</p>

<p>"You just dare to come near to me and
all your noses will be broken!"</p>

<p>The mosquitoes laughed in their shrill
voices and flew at the bear, full force,
squealing, swarming and attacking him.
Mishka beat them off again and again.
Without intending, he swallowed a hundred
of them, choking. He coughed and
the bough broke under the strain. Down
fell Mishka. But he was up again, patting
his bruised sides and saying:</p>

<p>"Who is the winner? You see how
skillful I am at jumping from trees."</p>

<p>The mosquitoes laughed in their thin,
shrill laughter. And Mosquito Long-Nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38]</a></span>
just trumpeted, "I'll eat you up! I'll
eat you up! I'll eat you up!"</p>

<p>Completely exhausted, Mishka knew
that he was beaten, but he was ashamed to
leave the marsh. He sat on his haunches,
but all he could do was to blink his eyes.</p>

<p>He was saved from further shame by a
Wise Frog. She came hopping along
from under a bush and seeing Mishka in
such difficulty, she said:</p>

<p>"Why do you bother yourself needlessly,
Master Mishka? Don't waste your
time with these nasty little mosquitoes.
They aren't worth it."</p>

<p>"They really are not," cried the bear
joyfully. "I was only fooling a bit. Just
let them visit my lair, then I'll ... I'll
... I'll...."</p>

<p>In a flash, Mishka turned and ran from
the marsh. But Mosquito Long-Nose
flew right after, shouting:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catch him, brothers! Catch him!
Hold him!"</p>

<p>The mosquitoes gathered in meeting
and decided, "It isn't worth while. Let
him go. The marsh is left. It did not
go away."</p>

Blow, trumpets! Toot-a-toot-too!</p>

Let's have music. All are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[ 41]</a></span>
welcome. Come, let us gather. Rub-a-dub-dub!
Toot-a-toot-too! Vanka is
strutting about in his new red blouse, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Brothers, you are welcome. There is
plenty to eat. The soup is made of the
freshest shavings; the cutlets of the very
best and cleanest sand; doughnuts of different-colored
papers; tea of the finest
boiling water. You are all welcome.
Music, play! Rub-a-dub-dub! Rub-a-dub-dub!
Toot-a-toot-too!"</p>

<p>The room was crowded with visitors.
The first to arrive was the bulging
Wooden Top.</p>

<p>"Z-z-z! Z-z-z! Where is the birthday
child? Z-z-z! Z-z-z! I am very fond of
making merry in good company."</p>

<p>The next to arrive were two Dolls; one,
blue-eyed Anya with a slightly damaged
nose; the other, black-eyed Katya with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42]</a></span>
one arm missing. Both came in very modestly
and sat down on the toy couch.</p>

<p>"Let us see the treat Vanka has for us,"
said Anya, "I think he boasts too much.
The music isn't bad, but I have my doubts
about the treat."</p>

<p>"Anya, you are always grumbling,"
said Katya, chidingly.</p>

<p>"And you are always ready to argue,"
said Anya.</p>

<p>The Dollies had a little argument and
were just about to quarrel, when a much
worn Clown hobbled in on one leg, and
made peace.</p>

<p>"Ladies, patience! Everything will be
very nice and we will have a good time.
Of course, I have only one leg, but Top
isn't any better off than I am. See him
spin on his one leg. Hello, old Top!"</p>

<p>"Z-z-z! Z-z-z! Hello! Why does one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43]</a></span>
of your eyes look as if someone had
punched you?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I fell off the couch.
Worse things than that happen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that. Spinning, I sometimes
strike my head against the wall full
force."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing your head is empty,"
said Clown.</p>

<p>"All the same, it hurts. Z-z-z! Just try
it and you'll find out."</p>

<p>Clown only clapped his brass cymbals
in answer. He was really a very light-minded
fellow.</p>

<p>Then came Petrooshka, bringing along
with him a crowd of visitors: his own
wife, Matryona Ivanovna; the German
doctor, Carl Ivanovitch; and a huge-nosed
Gypsy, riding on a three-legged horse.</p>

<p>"Now, Vanka, receive your visitors!"
said Petrooshka gaily, tapping his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44]</a></span>
nose. "They're all fine. Look at my own
wife, Matryona Ivanovna! Isn't she
splendid? She is as fond of tea as a duck
is of water."</p>

<p>"We will find some tea for her, Master
Petrooshka, and we are always glad to see
good company," said Vanka. "Please sit
down, Matryona Ivanovna. Carl Ivanovitch,
pray be seated."</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Bear with Mr. Rabbit,
Gray Billy Goat and Waddling Duckling,
Mr. Rooster and Mr. Wolf. There was
plenty of room for everyone.</p>

<p>The last to arrive was Verotchka's Slipper
with Verotchka's Broom. They
looked around and found all seats occupied.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I'll stand in the corner,"
said Broom.</p>

<p>Slipper said nothing, but crept silently
under the couch. She was a venerable old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45]</a></span>
Slipper, very much worn. She was
slightly embarrassed by the tiny hole near
her toe, but she hoped that under the
couch no one would notice that.</p>

<p>"Music, start!" ordered Vanka. "Drum,
beat! Rub-a-dub-dub! Trumpets toot!
Toot-a-toot-too!"</p>

<p>Immediately the guests became merry
and gay.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-a1"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>T the beginning, the party was
splendid. Drum did his own
beating, and Trumpet his own
tooting. Top buzzed, Clown
beat his cymbals and Petrooshka
squealed with all his might. It
was merry and gay.</p>

<p>"Friends, be happy!" called Vanka,
smoothing his flaxen curls.</p>

<p>Anya and Katya laughed in their shrill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46]</a></span>
voices, clumsy Bear danced with little
Broom, Gray Billy Goat strutted about
with Waddling Duck, Clown tumbled
about, showing off his tricks, and Dr. Carl
Ivanovitch, chatting with Matryona
Ivanovna, asked:</p>

<p>"Does your stomach ache, Matryona
Ivanovna?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Carl Ivanovitch," replied
Matryona Ivanovna, offended. "What
makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Just show me your tongue," insisted
the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, please."</p>

<p>"I'm here," rang the thin voice of Silver
Spoon, with which Verotchka ate her
cereal. She had been lying quietly on the
table until the Doctor spoke of showing a
tongue. Then she jumped up, for she
knew that the Doctor always needed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47]</a></span>
help when he looked at Verotchka's
tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Not that!" piped Matryona
Ivanovna, waving her arms comically, as
if she were a windmill.</p>

<p>"Very well. I will not burden you with
my services," said little Spoon, very
much offended. She was growing angry,
when little Top came spinning up to her
and invited her to dance. Top hummed.
Little Spoon rang.</p>

<p>Little Slipper could resist no longer.
She crept out from under the couch and
whispered to little Broom:</p>

<p>"I love you very much, little Broom."</p>

<p>Little Broom closed her eyes softly and
sighed: she loved to be loved. She was
such a modest little Broom, never boasting
as others do,&mdash;for instance, Matryona
Ivanovna, Anya, and Katya. These dollies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48]</a></span>
always liked to make fun of other
people's failings, saying:</p>

<p>"Clown has but one leg. Petrooshka's
nose is too long. Carl Ivanovitch is bald.
Gypsy is like a firebrand."</p>

<p>But Vanka, the birthday child, was criticized
most of all.</p>

<p>"He is too much of a moujik," Katya
said.</p>

<p>"And he boasts too much," added
Anya.</p>

<p>After dancing and making merry, they
all sat down at the table and the real feast
began. The dinner passed as a real birthday
dinner should; not without a few mishaps,
however. Bear almost ate Rabbit,
mistaking him for the cutlet. Top nearly
came to blows with Gypsy about little
Spoon. You see, Gypsy wanted to steal
little Spoon and he tried to put her into
his pocket. Petrooshka, a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49]</a></span>
squabbler, quarrelled with his wife over
nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Matryona Ivanovna, be calm," urged
Carl Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>"Petrooshka is really kind. Perhaps your
head aches. I have wonderful powders
for headaches."</p>

<p>"Doctor, do leave her alone," said Petrooshka.
"She is an impossible woman. I
love her very much. Come Matryona
Ivanovna, let us kiss and be friends."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Vanka. "That's
much better than quarreling. I hate to see
people quarrel. Just look ..."</p>

<p>Then something quite unexpected happened,
something so horrible, it's dreadful
to relate.</p>

<p>Drum beat&mdash;rub-a-dub-dub! Trumpets
blew&mdash;toot-a-toot-too. Clown clanged his
cymbals. Little Spoon laughed in her silver
voice. Top hummed. Rabbit shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50]</a></span>
merrily, "Bo! Bo! Bo!" Porcelain Dog
barked loudly. Rubber Cat meowed gently.
Bear stamped his feet with such force
that the floor shook. Gayest of all was
Gray Billy Goat. He was the best dancer.
And he shook his beard so comically and
bleated "Baa! Baa! Baa!" in his cracked
voice.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-h3"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>OW did it all happen? That
is hard to tell because of all
the guests only Verotchka's
Slipper remembered just
what had transpired. She
was the only sensible one. She crept away
under the couch just in time.</p>

<p>This is how it all happened. First the
Wooden Blocks went up to Vanka to congratulate
him. No-No-NO. That
isn't how it started. The Blocks really did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51]</a></span>
go up to Vanka, but the real cause of the
trouble was Katya. Yes, it was all her
fault. This pretty little rascal, towards the
very end of the dinner, whispered to
Anya:</p>

<p>"Anya, who do you think is the prettiest
of all here?"</p>

<p>It was quite a simple question to ask, but
Matryona Ivanovna, overhearing it, grew
frightfully offended and asked Katya:</p>

<p>"Do you think my Petrooshka is ugly?"</p>

<p>"Nobody thinks that," answered Katya,
trying to defend herself. But it was too
late.</p>

<p>"Of course, his nose is too big," continued
Matryona Ivanovna, "but that is
hardly noticeable, if you look at him sideways.
I know he has a bad habit of squealing
and squabbling with people but he
is really very kind. And as for
brains ..."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52]</a></span></p>

<p>She was unable to finish because the
Dolls began to argue with so much heat
that they attracted everybody's attention.
The first to interfere was, of course, Petrooshka
himself.</p>

<p>"It's true, Matryona Ivanovna," said he,
"I am the handsomest here."</p>

<p>Then the men were all offended.</p>

<p>"Just listen to this conceited Petrooshka!"
said they. "It's disgusting!"</p>

<p>Clown was not much of a talker, so he
was silently offended. But Dr. Carl
Ivanovitch almost shouted:</p>

<p>"Does that mean that the rest of us are
monsters? Gentlemen, I congratulate
you!"</p>

<p>There was great noise and confusion.
Gypsy shouted something in his own language.
Bear growled. Wolf howled.
Gray Billy Goat bawled. Top hummed.
They all shouted their offense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen, stop!" pleaded Vanka.
"Please pay no attention to Petrooshka. I
am sure he was only jesting."</p>

<p>It was all in vain. Carl Ivanovitch was
noisier and more excited than the rest. He
even pounded his fist on the table and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is a fine treat, I must
say! We were invited here only to be told
that we are monsters!"</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" shouted
Vanka, trying in vain to be heard. "If
monsters are under discussion, there is but
one monster here. It is I! Now are you
satisfied?"</p>

<p>Then, let us see what happened
next....</p>

<p>Carl Ivanovitch completely lost control
and flew at Petrooshka, with a threatening
fist.</p>

<p>"If I were not an educated man, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54]</a></span>
how to behave properly in decent
society, I would say to you, 'Master Petrooshka,
you are quite a fool.'"</p>

<p>Knowing Petrooshka's squabbling disposition,
Vanka tried to get between him
and the Doctor, but on his way, his fist
caught Petrooshka's long nose. Petrooshka
thought that it was not Vanka,
but the doctor who had struck him. And
that's how it all began.</p>

<p>Petrooshka clutched at the doctor.
Gypsy, seated at one side, began without
any provocation to pummel Clown. Bear
threw himself with a growl upon Wolf.
Top hit Billy Goat with his empty head.
In a word, there was a row. Dolls
squealed in their shrill voices and all three
fainted with fright.</p>

<p>"I'm fainting," screamed Matryona
Ivanovna, falling off the couch.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! What does all this
mean?" pleaded Vanka. "Gentlemen!
Is this not my birthday? Gentlemen!
This is rude!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_063vanka2.png" width="400" height="560" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56]</a></span></p>


<p>It was a real fight. The confusion was
so great that it was impossible to tell who
was beating whom. Vanka tried to separate
the fighters, but it ended in his beating
anybody and everybody who came within
his arm's reach. And as he was the
strongest, his guests came off pretty badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Help! Help! Heavens' help!" cried
Petrooshka, loudest of all, trying to strike
the Doctor.</p>

<p>"They are murdering Petrooshka!
Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Slipper was the only one who escaped
the fight. She crept under the couch just
in time. She closed her eyes in fear. Rabbit,
seeking safety, hid inside Slipper.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" grumbled
Slipper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep still! They might hear us and
then both of us would get it," pleaded
little Rabbit, peeping through the tiny
hole in Slipper's toe. "What a rascal that
Petrooshka is! He beats everyone and
shouts loudest of all. He's a fine guest, I
must say! You know I hardly got away
from Wolf. My! it's horror, just to think
of it! Just see Duckling with her tiny
legs up. Poor thing! She must be dead."</p>

<p>"How foolish you are, little Rabbit,"
said Slipper. "All the dolls have fainted
and so has Duckling."</p>

<p>They fought and fought and fought
until Vanka drove away all the guests except
the Dolls.</p>

<p>Matryona Ivanovna, tired of lying in a
faint, opened one eye and asked:</p>

<p>"Where am I? Doctor, will you see if
I am still alive?"</p>

<p>No one answered her and Matryona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59]</a></span>
Ivanovna opened her other eye. The
room was empty except for Vanka, who
stood in the center looking around, much
astonished. Anya and Katya also revived
and they, too, were amazed. Something
horrible must have happened.</p>

<p>"You're a fine birthday child, I must
say!" simultaneously exclaimed the Dolls,
addressing Vanka, who did not know
what to answer.</p>

<p>Someone hit him; he hit someone.
Why? Wherefore? He did not know.</p>

<p>"I really do not know how it all happened,"
said Vanka. "The thing that
hurts most is that I love them all. All
without exception."</p>

<p>"We know how it all happened," called
Slipper and Rabbit from under the couch.
"We saw it all."</p>

<p>"It is all your fault," said Matryona
Ivanovna, accusing little Slipper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60]</a></span>
Rabbit. "Of course, it is you who are to
blame. You started the row and then you
ran away and hid."</p>

<p>"They're to blame! They're to blame!"
screamed Anya and Katya in chorus.</p>

<p>"Now I see it all," cried Vanka, joyfully.
"Get out, you rascals! You only
visit people to start quarrels."</p>

<p>Slipper and Rabbit were barely able to
make their escape through the window.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you a lesson," threatened
Matryona Ivanovna, following in their
wake. "There are some nasty people in
this world! Even little Duckling will
agree with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said little Duckling. "I
saw them hide under the couch." Duckling
always agreed with everybody.</p>

<p>"Let the guests return," said Katya.
"We can still have a jolly time."</p>

<p>The guests were all glad to come back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61]</a></span>
Some had black eyes; some limped. Petrooshka's
long nose had the worst of it.</p>

<p>"The rascals!" all repeated in chorus,
blaming Rabbit and Slipper for everything.
"Who would have thought it of
them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so tired! My hands are all
sore," complained Vanka. "But let us
forget it and bear no grudge. Let's have
music."</p>

<p>Once more, drum beat&mdash;rub-a-dub-dub!
Trumpets blew&mdash;toot-a-toot-too!
And Petrooshka shouted with all his
might:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Vanka!"</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF MASTER SPARROW,
MASTER STICKELBACK AND THE
JOLLY CHIMNEY-SWEEP, YASHA</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-m3"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>ASTER Sparrow and Master
Stickelback were great
friends. In summer, Master
Sparrow came daily to the
river, calling:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, brother! How are you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well. Managing to keep alive,"
answered Stickelback. "Come to visit me.
The deep pools are fine. The water is
quiet. And it's just full of water grass. I
will treat you to frogs' eggs, worms and
water bugs."</p>

<p>"Thank you, brother, I would come
with pleasure, only I am afraid of the
water," said the Sparrow. "You better
visit me on my roof. I'll treat you to
berries&mdash;I have a whole garden full&mdash;and
we will rummage for some bread crusts,
some oats, a bit of sugar and live mosquitoes.
You like sugar, don't you?"</p>

<p>"What does it look like?" asked Stickelback.</p>

<p>"It is white."</p>

<p>"Like the pebbles in my river?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. But when you take it into
your mouth it's sweet. One can't eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64]</a></span>
pebbles, you know. Come, let us fly to
my roof."</p>

<p>"No, I can't fly. And I suffocate in the
open air," said the Fish. "Let us have a
swim together in my river. That's much
better. I will show you all sorts of
things."</p>

<p>Master Sparrow tried to get into the
water. He jumped in up to his knees;
then fear seized him&mdash;fear of drowning.
Heretofore, all that the Sparrow had ever
done was to get a drink of clear river water
and to take a bath in the shallowest part on
a hot day. Then he would shake his feathers
out and return to his roof.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the two were great
friends. They liked chatting together
about all sorts of things.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get tired of staying in
the water," Sparrow would say, wondering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65]</a></span>
"It is so wet. Aren't you afraid of
taking cold?"</p>

<p>Master Stickelback in his turn would
wonder at Master Sparrow:</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get tired of flying?
Isn't it too warm to be out in the sun? It
would just suffocate me. It is always cool
where I live. I swim as I like. When
summer comes, my river is crowded with
bathers. But who ever visits your roof?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have plenty of visitors. I have
one great chum, the Chimney-Sweep,
Yasha. He often visits me. He is such a
jolly Chimney-Sweep, always singing.
He cleans the chimneys, singing away.
When he rests, he sits on the very edge of
the roof, eats his piece of bread for lunch,
while I pick up the crumbs. We are great
friends. I also like to be jolly sometimes."</p>

<p>The Sparrow and the Fish had many
troubles in common. Winter was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66]</a></span>
hard on both. Poor Master Sparrow almost
froze to death. The days were so
bitter cold. His very soul seemed to
freeze within him. He would puff himself
up, tuck his legs underneath him and
sit on his roof, waiting for the sunshine.
There was only one other warm place for
him and that was the chimney, but even
here it was hardly safe.</p>

<p>Once, Master Sparrow almost perished.
It was the fault of his best friend, the
Chimney-Sweep. One day, Yasha came
to clean the chimney. His brush, with the
weight attached, came down the chimney
and almost smashed Master Sparrow's
head. Covered with soot, Master Sparrow
escaped from the chimney. He was
even blacker than Yasha.</p>

<p>"I say! What do you mean, Yasha?
You almost killed me," scolded Master
Sparrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_075house.png" width="400" height="557" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68]</a></span></p>


<p>"How was I to know you were sitting in
the chimney?" asked Yasha.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must be more careful," said
Master Sparrow. "It isn't very nice to be
hit by such a heavy weight. I am sure you
wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>In winter, Stickelback's life was not
very pleasant. He crawled somewhere
deep, deep into the river and dozed there
for days. It was dark and cold and he had
no desire to move. Occasionally he came
up to the ice-hole to chat with his friend.</p>

<p>When Master Sparrow came to the ice-hole
for a drink, he would call, "Hey,
Master Stickelback! Are you still alive?"</p>

<p>"I am," Master Stickelback would answer
sleepily. "But I want to stay asleep
all the time. It isn't very nice here.
Everybody is asleep."</p>

<p>"It isn't much better where I live," said
Sparrow. "But we must be patient. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70]</a></span>
times the wind is very cruel. There is no
sleep then. I hop along on one leg to keep
warm, while people watching me say,
'What a gay little sparrow!' If only warm
days would come! Brother, I believe you
are asleep again."</p>

<p>Summer brought with it its own
troubles. Once a hawk chased Master
Sparrow for two miles. Sparrow barely
escaped by hiding in the sedge near the
river.</p>

<p>"My! I am glad to get off alive," complained
Master Sparrow to Master Stickelback,
scarcely able to catch his breath.
"That rascal almost caught me then."</p>

<p>"He must be something like our pike,"
said Stickelback, consolingly. "Not long
ago I, too, barely escaped the pike's fangs.
That pike was as quick as lightning. One
day, as I was swimming out with some
friends, I mistook him for a log, he lay so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[ 71]</a></span>
still, and he chased me. Will you tell me
why there are pikes in the world? I have
often wondered, but I cannot understand."</p>

<p>"Neither can I," said Master Sparrow.
"Do you know, I sometimes think that a
hawk must at one time have been a pike
and a pike must have been a hawk. Anyway,
both are rascals."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t2"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HUS lived Master Sparrow
and Master Stickelback, freezing
in winter, joyous in summer;
while jolly Chimney-Sweep,
Yasha, cleaned his
chimneys and sang his songs. Each had
his work, his joys and his troubles.</p>

<p>One summer day the Chimney-Sweep
walked down to the river to wash. He
walked along, whistling, when suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72]</a></span>
he heard a terrific noise. What had happened?</p>

<p>Whirling above the river was a crowd
of birds, ducks, geese, swallows, snipe,
crows and pigeons, shouting with laughter,
for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>"I say! What has happened?" asked
the Chimney-Sweep.</p>

<p>"This is what happened," piped a bold
Bluebird. "It is too funny for words.
Just see what Master Sparrow is doing.
He seems quite mad."</p>

<p>The Bluebird piped in her thin, high
voice, flicked her tail and soared above the
river. When Chimney-Sweep drew
nearer, Master Sparrow just flew at him.
He was frightful to behold. His beak
was open, his eyes wild, his feathers all
ruffled.</p>

<p>"Master Sparrow, what is all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73]</a></span>
about? Why are you making all this
noise?" asked the Chimney-Sweep.</p>

<p>"No! I'll teach him a few things!"
shouted Master Sparrow, fairly choking
with rage. "He doesn't yet know who I
am! I'll teach that confounded Stickelback!
He'll have cause to remember me!
The rascal!"</p>

<p>"Don't listen to him," shouted Stickelback
from his river. "It's all lies."</p>

<p>"Who is lying?" shouted Master Sparrow.
"Who found the worm? I'm lying?
Indeed! A nice fat worm that I
myself dug up on the bank. I worked
hard, too. I finally got him and was just
about ready to take him home to my nest&mdash;I
have a family, you know, that has to be
fed. No sooner did I get above the river,
the worm in my mouth, than that abominable
Stickelback (I hope the pike swallows
him) shouted, 'Hawk! Hawk!' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74]</a></span>
screamed with fright and the worm dropped
out of my mouth into the water and
Master Stickelback swallowed him. I call
this cheating. There was no hawk in
sight."</p>

<p>"It was only a little joke of mine," said
Stickelback, defending himself. "That
worm was really delicious."</p>

<p>All kinds of fish were gathered about
Stickelback, minnows, carp and perch,
listening and laughing at the story.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was a fine trick Master
Stickelback played on his old friend. But
funnier still was to see Master Sparrow
fighting Master Stickelback, flying at him
again and again and getting nothing."</p>

<p>"I hope my worm chokes you! I'll dig
up another," shouted Master Sparrow.
"What hurts me most is that Stickelback
fooled me and now he laughs at me. I was
even inviting him to visit me on my roof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75]</a></span>
A fine friend he is, I must say! Here's
our Chimney-Sweep, Yasha. He will
agree with me, I'm sure. He's my good
friend. At times, we even eat together.
Yasha eats his bread and I pick up the
crumbs."</p>

<p>"Wait, brothers! This affair needs a
judge," announced Yasha. "Just let me
wash myself and I shall deal with the
whole thing fairly. And you, Master
Sparrow, just calm yourself a bit."</p>

<p>"I know I am right. I have nothing to
worry about," shouted Master Sparrow.
"I only want to show Stickelback that I
shall not stand for his jokes."</p>

<p>Chimney-Sweep Yasha sat down on the
bank, put his lunch near him, washed his
face and hands, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, brothers, let us get at the bottom
of this trouble. You, Master Stickelback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76]</a></span>
are a fish. And you, Master Sparrow, are
a bird. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," shouted the birds and fishes
in chorus.</p>

<p>"Let us go on," said Yasha. "A fish must
live in water, a bird in the air. Am I
right? Well then, a worm lives in the
ground. Very well. Now let's see."</p>

<p>The Chimney-Sweep opened his lunch,
a piece of wheaten bread, and laid it on a
stone, saying:</p>

<p>"Now look! What is this? Bread,
isn't it? I earned it and I shall eat it. And
with it, I shall have a drink of water. All
this means that I have earned my dinner
without harming anyone. A fish and a
bird also want their dinner. Each of you
has his own food. Why quarrel? Master
Sparrow dug up the worm, therefore the
worm was his. He earned it."</p>

<p>"Wait, Uncle," piped a thin voice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[ 77]</a></span>
the crowd. The birds moved apart to
allow a little snipe to come forward.
Standing on his thin little legs close to the
Chimney-Sweep, the snipe said:</p>

<p>"It isn't true, Uncle."</p>

<p>"What isn't true?" asked Yasha.</p>

<p>"About the worm," said the snipe. "I
found it. You can ask the ducks. They
saw me. I found the worm and Master
Sparrow snatched it away from me."</p>

<p>Chimney-Sweep Yasha was puzzled.
This was quite a different story.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he murmured, trying to
gather his thoughts together. "Hey,
Master Sparrow! What do you mean by
lying to me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not lying. The snipe is. He and
the ducks made that story up."</p>

<p>"Well, brothers, something is wrong.
Of course, a worm isn't anything, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78]</a></span>
steal it, is not nice. And he who steals
must lie. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"Right! You are right!" shouted all in
chorus. "All the same, you have to be the
judge between Master Stickelback and
Master Sparrow."</p>

<p>"Which of those two is right?" asked
Yasha. "Both made a noise. Both fought
and stirred up everybody else. Who is
right? Oh, the two of you, Master Stickelback
and Master Sparrow, the two of you
are rascals. I will punish both of you as
an example. Now, both of you make up
quickly."</p>

<p>"That's right," shouted the crowd in
chorus. "Let them make up."</p>

<p>"As for the snipe who worked to get the
worm, I will feed him with my crust," decided
the Chimney-Sweep. "Then everybody
will be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" all shouted their approval.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chimney-Sweep made a move to
offer his crust to the snipe, but the crust
had disappeared. While Yasha was talking,
Master Sparrow grabbed the crust
and flew away with it.</p>

<p>"The rascal! The scamp!" shouted the
birds and the fishes indignantly, starting
in pursuit of the thief.</p>

<p>The crust was heavy and Master Sparrow
could not fly far with it. He was
caught just beyond the river. Birds, large
and small, threw themselves upon the
thief. It was a real battle. They were all
tearing the bread to bits and the crumbs
fell into the river. These the fishes grabbed.
Then followed a battle between
birds and fish. The crust was broken into
tiny crumbs. The crumbs were eaten up.
When it was all over, everybody grew
thoughtful. They felt ashamed. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80]</a></span>
chasing the thief to recover the crust, they
had grabbed it up themselves.</p>

<p>The jolly Chimney-Sweep, Yasha, sat
on the bank, watching and laughing. The
whole affair had turned out to be so funny.
They were all gone. There remained only
the Sandy Snipe.</p>

<p>"Why don't you fly along with the
others?" asked the Chimney-Sweep.</p>

<p>"I would, Uncle, only I am too small.
The big birds might peck me to death."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you are right, little Snipe.
Both of us are left without our dinner.
Evidently, we haven't worked hard
enough for it."</p>

<p>Then came Verotchka to the river bank
and asked the jolly Chimney-Sweep what
had happened. How she laughed when
she heard the story!</p>

<p>"How foolish they all are, the fish and
the birds," said Verotchka. "I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81]</a></span>
divide everything right, and no one would
quarrel. Not long ago I divided four
apples. Father brought four apples and
said, 'Divide these between you and Lisa
and me evenly.' I divided them into three
parts. I gave one apple to father, one
apple to Lisa, and I took two apples for
myself."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE LAST FLY</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-s2"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>UMMER-TIME is a merry time
for flies. It is hard to tell just
how it all happened. There were
so many flies; thousands of them,
gaily flying and buzzing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[ 83]</a></span></p>

<p>When Little Fly was born, she
straightened out her wings and immediately
felt happy,&mdash;so happy that one
really cannot tell it in words. It was all so
interesting. The doors and windows leading
to the porch were thrown wide open in
the morning, and Little Fly flitted in and
out as she pleased.</p>

<p>"How kind human beings are!" exclaimed
Little Fly, astonished, flying in
and out of the windows. "The windows
were made for us, and they are open for us.
It is so nice to be alive and feeling so
happy."</p>

<p>She flew in and out of the garden many
times. Sitting on a blade of grass, she admired
the blooming lilacs, the delicate
leaves of the budding poplars, and the different
flowers in their beds. The gardener,
still unknown to her, had taken care of
everything. What a kind gardener! Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84]</a></span>
Fly was not born yet and he had already
prepared everything she might need. It
was all the more amazing since he himself
was not only unable to fly, but he even
walked about with great difficulty, trembling
all over at times, and muttering to
himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder where these nasty flies come
from?" grumbled the kind gardener.</p>

<p>The poor dear probably said this from
sheer envy because all he could do was to
dig beds, set out and water flowers. He
couldn't fly. Little Fly liked to buzz
around the gardener's red nose, which annoyed
him very much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_093gardener.png" width="400" height="552" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86]</a></span></p>


<p>People were usually very kind, providing
all kinds of pleasures for flies. For instance,
when Verotchka had her bread
and milk in the morning, she always asked
Aunt Olga for a piece of sugar. This she
did just to give Little Fly a chance to have
a bit of sugar, a few crumbs of bread, and
a few drops of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now tell me, is there anything more
delicious than this treat after working
busily all morning?" said Little Fly.</p>

<p>Cook Pascha was even kinder than
Verotchka. Every morning she would go
to market and bring such wonderful
things, especially for the flies&mdash;meat, fish,
cream and butter. Pascha was the kindest
woman in the whole house. Though, like
the gardener, she could not fly, she knew
perfectly well every need of a fly. She was
the kindest woman in all the world.</p>

<p>And Aunt Olga&mdash;oh, that wonderful
woman!&mdash;seemed to live only for the flies.
With her own hands she would open all
the windows every morning, so that the
flies might come and go at will. When it
rained, or it was cold, she closed the windows
to keep their little wings dry and prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88]</a></span>
them from catching cold. Then
Aunt Olga noticed that flies liked sugar
and berries. So every day she cooked berries
and sugar. The flies knew at once
why she did this, and to show their gratitude,
they crawled right into the pans of
jam.</p>

<p>Verotchka was also very fond of jam,
but Aunt Olga would only give her one or
two teaspoonfuls, because she did not wish
to deprive the flies of their share. As the
flies could not eat all the jam at once, Aunt
Olga put away the jam in jars (to keep it
away from mice who were not entitled to
jam) ready to serve to the flies each day at
tea time.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind and good everybody is!"
exclaimed Little Fly, flitting in and out of
the window. "It is even good that people
cannot fly, for they would turn into big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89]</a></span>
greedy flies, grabbing up everything. It's
fine to live in this world!"</p>

<p>"But people aren't at all as kind as you
think," remarked an old fly who liked to
grumble occasionally. "It only seems so
to you. Have you ever noticed the man
they call Papa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He is a very strange gentleman.
You are perfectly right, good old
fly. Why does he smoke that pipe? He
knows very well I do not like tobacco
smoke. It seems to me sometimes that he
does it just to spite me. And he doesn't
like to do anything for flies. You know,
once I tasted that ink with which he is forever
writing, and I almost died. It was
awful. I once saw with my own eyes two
pretty, inexperienced young flies drown in
his ink. It was a dreadful sight to see how
he pulled them out with his pen, put them
on his paper, making a splendid blot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90]</a></span>
Just think of it! Then he blames us and
not himself. Where is justice?"</p>

<p>"I think this Papa has no sense of justice,
although he has one good quality,"
answered the old, experienced fly. "He
drinks beer after dinner. That isn't at all
a bad habit. To tell the truth, I like a taste
of beer myself, though it does make me
dizzy."</p>

<p>"I also like beer," confessed Little Fly,
blushing slightly. "I become quite gay
after having some, although my head
aches the next day. Perhaps Papa does
not do anything for flies because he does
not care for jam and puts all of his sugar
into his tea. One really cannot expect
much of a man who does not eat jam.
There is nothing left for him but his pipe."</p>

<p>The flies knew people very well, although
they interpreted them in their own
fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t3"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE summer was hot. Each
day brought more and more
flies. They fell into the milk,
crawled into the soup and
into the ink-well, they buzzed
and they whirled and annoyed everyone.
Our Little Fly grew up into a big fly. On
several occasions she almost perished.
The first time her legs stuck in jam and
she was just able to free herself. The
second time she flew sleepily against a
burning lamp and almost scorched her
wings. The third time she was almost
crushed by a closing window. On the
whole, she had many adventures.</p>

<p>"There is no living with these flies
about," complained Cook. "They act
like mad&mdash;crawling into everything.
They must be done away with."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Even our Fly decided that there were altogether
too many flies, especially in the
kitchen. At night the ceiling was black
with them. They seemed like a moving
net. When the provisions were brought,
the flies threw themselves upon them&mdash;a
live mass, pushing, jostling, quarrelling.
The best morsels fell to the lot of the bold
and the strong. The rest had the remains.</p>

<p>Pascha, the cook, was right. There
were too many flies. Then something horrible
happened. One morning, Pascha
brought along with the provisions a package
of very tasty papers&mdash;that is, she made
them tasty, when she spread them out on
plates, by moistening them with warm
water and sprinkling sugar over them.</p>

<p>"There is a fine treat for the flies," said
Pascha, putting the plates where they
could be seen. Without Pascha's saying
anything, the flies knew at once that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93]</a></span>
was a special treat for them. Buzzing
gaily, they threw themselves upon the new
dainty. Our Fly tried to get into a plate,
but she was pushed rudely aside.</p>

<p>"No pushing, please," said she, offended,
"I'm not one of those greedy ones, you
know. You are quite rude."</p>

<p>Then something quite terrible happened.
Thousands of flies died. The
greediest were the first to succumb. They
crawled about as if drunk and then fell to
the ground, dead. In the morning, Pascha
swept up a large plate full of dead flies.
Only the most sensible ones remained
alive. Among these was our Fly.</p>

<p>"No papers for us," buzzed the surviving
flies. "We don't want them."</p>

<p>The next day the same thing happened.
Of all the sensible flies only the most sensible
remained alive. But Pascha still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94]</a></span>
complained, "There is no living with these
flies about."</p>

<p>Then the gentleman they called Papa
brought home three very pretty glass
bowls and filled them with beer. This
time even the most sensible flies were
caught. It turned out that these bowls
were nothing but fly-catchers. The flies,
attracted by the smell of beer, were caught
in the bowls and perished.</p>

<p>"That's good," said Pascha approvingly.
She had turned out to be the most
heartless of women, rejoicing at others'
misfortunes.</p>

<p>"There isn't anything good about that,"
said Little Fly. "If people had wings like
flies and someone were to set a fly-catcher
as big as a house, they, too, would be
caught."</p>

<p>Our Fly, learning from the bitter experiences
of the sensible flies, ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[ 95]</a></span>
trust people. They only seem kind, these
people; while, in reality, they are busy
with just one thing&mdash;to cheat poor trusting
flies. To tell the truth, human beings
are the slyest and crudest of animals.</p>

<p>Through all these misfortunes the number
of flies decreased considerably. Then
followed another calamity. Suddenly
summer was gone. Rains began to fall.
Cold winds blew. The weather was very
disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Is summer really gone?" asked the few
remaining flies. "How could it have
passed so quickly. It doesn't seem quite
fair. We have hardly had time to live and
autumn is already upon us."</p>

<p>This was worse than poison paper or
glass fly-catchers. There was only one
escape from the coming bad weather&mdash;to
seek shelter with one's bitterest enemy,
Master Man. Alas, now the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96]</a></span>
were closed all day long and only the ventilators
were occasionally open! The
very sun seemed to shine just to deceive
the trustful house flies.</p>

<p>For instance, what do you think of this
picture? It is morning. The sun is gaily
peeping into all the windows as if inviting
the flies into the garden. You would
think summer was returning. And what
happens? The trustful flies fly through
the ventilator into the garden. True, the
sun is shining, but it gives no heat. They
try to return to the house but the ventilator
has been closed. Thus many flies
perished in the cold autumn nights.</p>

<p>"No, I no longer believe," said our Little
Fly, "I have no faith in anything.
Since even the sun deceives me, I believe
in nothing."</p>

<p>It is understood that with the coming of
the fall all flies experienced the same unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97]</a></span>
moods. They became very disagreeable.
Not a sign of their former
gayety remained. They became gloomy,
indolent and dissatisfied. Some of them
even began to bite, which they had never
been known to do before.</p>

<p>Our Fly's disposition became so bad she
didn't know herself. She had always been
so sorry for other flies. Now when they
perished, she thought only of herself. She
was even ashamed to speak the thoughts
that were in her mind, "Let them perish,
then there will be more left for me." In
the first place, there were not many warm
corners where a decent fly could spend the
winter. In the second place, the other flies
were very annoying, always in the way,
snatching from under her nose the very
best tidbits, and behaving badly in general.
Besides, it was time for them to rest.</p>

<p>The flies seemed to understand the cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98]</a></span>
thoughts of our Fly and they fell by the
hundreds. They didn't seem to die&mdash;just
to fall asleep. With each day their number
grew smaller and smaller. There was
no longer any need of poison paper or
glass fly-catchers. But all this was not
enough to satisfy our Fly. She wanted to
be the only fly left in the world.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t4"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HERE came a very happy
day. One morning our Fly
woke up quite late. She had
felt a curious weariness for a
long time and preferred to remain
immovable in her corner under the
stove. And now she felt that something
unusual was going to happen. She flew
to the window. The first snow had fallen!
The ground was covered with a brilliant,
white, shining sheet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, this must be winter!" Our Fly
knew at once. "Winter is all white, like a
piece of sugar."</p>

<p>Then our Fly noticed that all the other
flies had disappeared. The poor things
could not survive the first frost and dropped
off to sleep wherever they happened to
be. In former days, our Fly would have
felt very sorry for them. But now she
thought, "This is splendid. Now I am
really the only one. No one will eat my
jam, my sugar, my crumbs. This is fine."</p>

<p>She flew through all the rooms to convince
herself that she was the only fly left.
Now she could do anything she pleased.
It was so nice. The house was so warm.
Winter was there, out of doors; but inside
the house it was bright, warm, and cozy,
especially in the evening when the candles
and lamps were lighted. A slight misfortune
occurred when the first lamp was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100]</a></span>
lighted. Our Fly once more flew against
it and was almost scorched to death.</p>

<p>"This must be the winter fly-trap," said
our Fly, rubbing her burnt legs. "Now
you can't fool me. I know too much. You
wish to burn the Last Fly, do you? Well,
that's the last thing that I want. There is
also a hot stove in the kitchen. Don't I
know that, too, is a fly-catcher?"</p>

<p>The Last Fly was happy for a few days
only. Then suddenly she felt lonely, so
lonely, so very lonely. Of course, she was
warm and there was plenty to eat, but still
she was unhappy. She flew and rested and
ate. She flew again, but she felt lonelier
than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lonely I am!" she buzzed in
a thin, pitiful voice, flying from one room
to the other. "If there were only one other
fly here! The meanest, the worst of them,
but only one fly!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[ 101]</a></span></p>

<p>No one seemed to understand the complaints
of the Last Fly and this of course
made her cross. She flew about like one
mad, alighting on this one's nose, on that
one's ear, or back and forth in front of
people's eyes.</p>

<p>"Heavens, can't you understand? I am
quite alone in the world and I am very,
very lonely," she would buzz at every one.
"You don't even know how to fly. How
can you know loneliness? If someone
were only to play with me! But no, how
can they? What can be clumsier and
heavier than a human being? The ugliest
creatures I have ever met."</p>

<p>The Last Fly annoyed the dog and the
cat and everybody else. She was most
hurt when she heard Aunt Olga say,
"Please don't touch the Last Fly. Leave
her alone. Let her live through the winter."
This was insulting! It sounded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102]</a></span>
if she was not even considered a fly. "Let
her live." What a kindness!</p>

<p>"But I am so lonely! Maybe I don't
want to live. That's all there's to it."</p>

<p>The Last Fly was so angry at everybody
that she grew frightened at herself. She
flew, she buzzed, she squeaked, she
squealed. The spider in the corner finally
took pity on her and said:</p>

<p>"Dear fly, come to me. See how pretty
my web is!"</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said the Last
Fly. "Are you my new friend? I know
what your pretty cob web means. You
were probably a human being at one time
who is now pretending to be a spider."</p>

<p>"You know I wish you well," said the
spider.</p>

<p>"Oh, you ugly creature!" said the Fly.
"To eat the Last Fly means to wish me
well, hey?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103]</a></span></p>

<p>They had a great quarrel. Nevertheless,
it was lonely, too lonely for words to
tell. The Fly was bitter against everybody.
She grew weary and in a loud voice
announced:</p>

<p>"Since all of you refuse to understand
how lonely I am, I will sit here in the corner
the whole winter through. That's all
there is to it! Yes, I will stay in the corner
and nothing will make me leave it. So
there!"</p>

<p>When she returned to her corner she
cried, thinking of last summer's gladness.
There had been so many merry flies. How
foolish she had been to desire to be left
alone. That had been a great mistake.</p>

<p>The winter seemed endless and Last Fly
was beginning to think that summer
would never return. She wished to die
and she wept quietly. Surely human beings
invented winter.  They always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104]</a></span>
seemed to think of things that harmed
flies. Perhaps it was Aunt Olga who had
hidden away the summer, as she did sugar
and jam. Last Fly was almost dead with
despair when something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>One day she was sitting in her corner,
as was her custom, when she suddenly
heard, "Buzz! Buzz!" She couldn't believe
her own ears at first and then she
thought that someone was fooling her.
And then&mdash;heavens!&mdash;what was that? A
real live fly! A Fly, very young, flew past.
It was just born and it was glad.</p>

<p>"Spring is coming! Spring is coming!"
it buzzed.</p>

<p>How glad the two were to see each
other! They embraced and kissed, and
licked each other's feelers. The Last Fly
talked for days, telling her new friend
what an awful winter she had spent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105]</a></span>
how lonely she had been. The young fly
only laughed in her thin little voice. She
couldn't understand how anyone could be
lonely.</p>

<p>"Spring! Spring!" she joyfully repeated.</p>

<p>When Aunt Olga ordered the winter
windows removed and Verotchka leaned
out of the first open window, Last Fly
knew what was happening.</p>

<p>"Now, I know it all," buzzed Last Fly,
flying out of the window. "We flies make
the summer."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A BLACK-HEADED CROW
AND A LITTLE YELLOW CANARY</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t5"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Black-Headed Crow sat in
a birch tree, pecking at a twig.
Peck! Peck! She cleaned
her bill, looked around, and
suddenly cawed, "Caw! Caw!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[ 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The drowsy cat, Vaska, sitting on a
fence, almost fell off with fright at the
noise and growled:</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Blackhead?
The Lord has given you some
voice! What are you happy about?"</p>

<p>The Crow answered, "Leave me alone.
Don't you see I'm busy? Caw! Caw!
Caw! So much to do, so much to do."</p>

<p>"You poor thing," laughed Vaska.</p>

<p>"Keep still, you lazy thing. Your sides
must be all worn out with lying about, forever
baking in the sun; while I know no
rest from early morning. Look at me.
Just see what I've done today. I perched
on ten roofs, flew over half the town,
peeped into every corner and hole there is,
and now I must fly up the church steeple,
visit the market, and dig a little in the
garden. But I'm really wasting time talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108]</a></span>
to you. Too busy! Too busy! Caw!
Caw! Caw!"</p>

<p>The Crow pecked her beak for the last
time against the twig, shook her feathers
out and was just ready to fly off when she
heard a terrible noise. A flock of sparrows
was noisily chasing a tiny little yellow
bird.</p>

<p>"Catch her! Catch her!" squawked the
sparrows.</p>

<p>"What's happened? Whither away?"
cawed the Crow, following the sparrows.</p>

<p>The Crow flapped her wings ten times
and caught up with the sparrows. The
tiny yellow bird, completely exhausted,
dropped into the little garden overgrown
with bushes of lilacs, currants
and syringa, to hide from the pursuing
sparrows. The little yellow bird hid
under a bush and there was the Crow.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" cawed the Crow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The sparrows scattered over that bush
like a handful of peas. They were furious
with the little yellow bird and wanted to
peck her to death.</p>

<p>"What do you want with her?" asked
the Crow.</p>

<p>"Why is she yellow?" peeped the sparrows
in chorus.</p>

<p>The Crow looked at the little yellow
bird. She certainly was all yellow. He
jerked his head and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you mischiefs! Why, it isn't a bird
at all! There never was a bird like this!
However, all you clear out. I must speak
with this curiosity that pretends to be a
bird."</p>

<p>The sparrows piped, chatted, and were
very angry, but they had to clear out. Conversations
with a Crow are always very
brief. He can peck you to death, you
know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110]</a></span></p>

<p>After chasing the sparrows, the Crow
questioned the little yellow bird that was
breathing heavily and looking pitifully at
him with her little black eyes.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Crow.</p>

<p>"I am a canary."</p>

<p>"No fooling now, or you will get the
worst of it. Remember, if it had not been
for me, the sparrows would have pecked
you to death."</p>

<p>"But I am a canary."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked the
Crow.</p>

<p>"I lived in a cage. I was born in a cage.
I grew up in a cage. But I always wanted
to fly about like other birds. The cage
hung near the window and I always
watched other birds. They looked so
happy and my cage seemed so small.
Well, one day when the little girl,
Verotchka, brought my cup of water, she
left the door open and I flew out. I flew
about the room first and then I flew out
through the open window."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_119crowcanary.png" width="400" height="561" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112]</a></span></p>


<p>"What were you doing in a cage?" said
the Crow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[ 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am a singer, you know."</p>

<p>"Just sing for me, then," said the Crow.</p>

<p>The Canary sang. The Crow, with his
head tilted to one side, listened and wondered.</p>

<p>"You call this singing?" he exclaimed.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! How foolish were
your masters to feed you for such singing.
If they fed anyone, why should it not have
been a real bird like me? Just a while ago
I cawed and that rascal Vaska almost fell
off the fence. That's what I call singing."</p>

<p>"I know Vaska, a most awful beast!
Many a time he softly crept to my cage, his
green eyes burning, his claws out."</p>

<p>"To some, he seems fierce, but not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114]</a></span>
others. That he is sly, is true, but there is
nothing fierce about him. However, we
can talk about this later, for somehow I
cannot yet believe that you are a real
bird."</p>

<p>"But, Aunty, I am a bird. I am a real
bird. All canaries are birds, you know."</p>

<p>"Very well. We shall see. How do you
expect to make a living?"</p>

<p>"I don't need very much, really. A few
seeds, a bit of sugar and a bit of toast.
That is all."</p>

<p>"What a lady you are! A bit of sugar
indeed! You can do without sugar. As
for seeds, those might be found. On the
whole, I like you. Do you want to live
with me? I have a splendid nest in the
birch tree."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But how about the sparrows?"</p>

<p>"If you live with me, no one will dare to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115]</a></span>
touch you. Not only the sparrows, but
even sly Vaska knows my character well.
I don't like fooling."</p>

<p>The Canary at once took courage and
flew off with the Crow. Yes, the nest was
fine. If there were only some toast and a
wee bit of sugar!</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-s3"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>O the Canary and the Crow lived
together in one nest. Although
the Crow liked to grumble occasionally,
on the whole she was
not unkind. Her chief fault was
that she envied everybody and very often
considered herself abused.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why the foolish hens
are better than I? Just see how they are
cared for, fed and watched," she would
complain to the Canary. "Then look at
the pigeons. Of what use are they? and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116]</a></span>
still look at the handfuls of oats they get.
They are so foolish. Yet whenever I
come near I am chased from every corner.
Is this just? And I'm scolded, too.
Haven't you noticed that I'm nicer than
other birds and much prettier, too? However,
one should not say such things about
oneself. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>The Canary agreed with everything.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are a big bird," she would
say.</p>

<p>"Here you are. They keep parrots in
cages and look after them. Can you see
why the foolish parrot is better than I?
He only knows how to scream and chatter
and no one can really understand what
he says."</p>

<p>"I know. We had a parrot that every
one grew tired of," said the Canary.</p>

<p>"Yes, one can think of many birds that
live, no one knows why. For instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117]</a></span>
starling; it comes like a mad thing no one
knows whence, stays through the summer,
and flies away again. There are also the
swallows, the bluebirds and nightingales,
but one can't really count all this rubbish.
There isn't a single really desirable bird.
Why, just as soon as there is a cold breeze,
all of them seem to fly away, the Lord
knows where."</p>

<p>In reality, the Crow and the Canary did
not understand each other. The Canary
could not understand a life of freedom;
the Crow could not understand a life of
captivity.</p>

<p>"Aunty, has no one ever thrown you a
bit of seed," wondered the Canary, "not a
single grain?"</p>

<p>"How foolish you are to talk of seeds,
when I have to dodge sticks and stones.
People are very cruel."</p>

<p>With this, the Canary could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[ 118]</a></span>
agree, because people had always been
kind to her. She thought that the Crow
imagined these things, but the Canary was
soon to see the cruelty of people. Once,
perched on a fence, she heard a heavy
stone whizz over her very head. Some
school boys walking past the fence saw
the Crow and couldn't resist throwing a
stone at her.</p>

<p>"Now, have you seen for yourself?"
asked the Crow, climbing upon the roof.
"People are always like that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have done something to
annoy them, Aunty."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. They are just cruel
and all of them hate me."</p>

<p>The Canary felt very sorry for the poor
Crow whom no one loved. It must be
very hard to live under such circumstances.</p>

<p>On the whole, there were many enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119]</a></span>
For instance, Vaska, with his oily eyes,
watching the birds and always feigning
sleep. The Canary saw with her own
eyes how he caught a young inexperienced
sparrow; one could only see the
feathers flying, and hear the bones crackling.
Horrible! Horrible! Then the
hawks, too; very fine to watch them as
they sail up into the air, but suddenly you
see them, like a heavy stone dropping to
the ground, and before you know it, a
chick is in their claws.</p>

<p>All this the Canary saw. The Crow,
however, was not afraid of either cats or
hawks. She often had a notion to have a
taste of a young bird herself. At first, the
Canary could not believe this, but she
really did see this with her own eyes. A
flock of sparrows were chasing the Crow,
chattering and screaming.</p>

<p>"Let her go! Let her go!" screamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120]</a></span>
the sparrows, beside themselves, flying
over the Crow's nest in a frenzy. "This is
awful! This is real robbery!"</p>

<p>The Crow hid deep in her nest and the
Canary saw with horror a bleeding sparrow,
dead.</p>

<p>"Aunty, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Keep still!" said the Crow.</p>

<p>Her eyes were horrible. They seemed
to burn. The Canary had to shut her own
eyes for fear she would see the Crow gobbling
up the poor little victim.</p>

<p>"Some day she may even eat me,"
thought the Canary.</p>

<p>Having satisfied her hunger, the Crow
grew kinder and kinder. She cleaned her
bill, perched comfortably and fell into a
sweet slumber. The Canary noticed that
the Crow was very greedy and not very
particular as to what she ate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes she would carry a piece of
bread, a bit of decayed meat, or some leavings
found in a dump hole. The dump
hole the Crow liked best, but the Canary
could never understand the pleasure of
digging in such places.</p>

<p>In fact, it was hard to blame the Crow.
She alone ate in one day food enough for
twenty canaries. The Crow had only one
care&mdash;food. Perched on some roof, she
was always on the lookout for food.</p>

<p>When the Crow was too lazy to search
for food, she would resort to slyness. If
she saw a flock of sparrows tearing at
something, she would fly right over to
them, pretending she was just passing by,
cawing with her whole might, "Caw!
Caw! I'm busy! I'm busy!"</p>

<p>She would then swoop down, grab the
booty, and that was the end of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it isn't a bit nice to take food away
from others," once remarked the indignant
Canary.</p>

<p>"Isn't it? But what if I am hungry?"</p>

<p>"Others are hungry, too," said the
Canary.</p>

<p>"Well, let them look out for themselves.
It is easy enough for you, the pets, cuddled
in cages. We have to get our own food.
You and the sparrows&mdash;how much do you
need? A few grains and you are satisfied
for the whole day."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-s4"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>UMMER passed unnoticed. The
sun seemed to grow colder, the
day shorter. Rains began to fall.
A cold wind blew. The Canary
felt herself a most unfortunate
bird, especially when it rained. But the
Crow did not seem to mind it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[ 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"What if it does rain? It will stop,"
said the Crow.</p>

<p>"But it is so cold, too cold, Aunty,"
said the Canary.</p>

<p>It was especially hard at night. The
little wet Canary would shiver with cold
and the Crow would scold at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you baby! What will you do
when the real frost comes and the snow
falls?"</p>

<p>The Crow was puzzled. "What sort of
bird is this that is afraid of rain, wind and
cold?" And she began to doubt once more
whether the Canary was a real bird, after
all. "Surely she must be pretending."</p>

<p>"Truly, Aunty, I am a real bird," the
Canary would assert with tears in her eyes,
"even if I do feel cold sometimes."</p>

<p>"Look out, now! It always seems to me
that you are only pretending to be a bird,"
said the Crow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Honestly, Aunty, I'm not pretending."</p>

<p>Sometimes the Canary would try to
think about her future. Perhaps it would
have been better to have stayed in the cage,
after all. There it was warm and one always
had plenty to eat.</p>

<p>Several times she flew up to the window,
where her old cage hung. Two new
canaries looked out at her and envied her.</p>

<p>"Oh, how cold it is!" pitifully piped the
freezing Canary. "How I would like to
be in there with you."</p>

<p>One morning the Canary looked out of
the Crow's nest. She was astonished at the
dreary sight. Over night, the ground had
been covered with the first snow. Everything
was white, but, saddest of all, the
snow covered all the grains on which the
Canary fed. There remained only the
mountain ash berry, but she couldn't possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[ 125]</a></span>
eat that! It was too sour! As for the
Crow, she ate that, saying, "Very fine!"</p>

<p>After starving two whole days, the
Canary was in despair.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen to me? I will
die of hunger," thought the Canary.</p>

<p>The next day the Canary sat wondering
when suddenly she saw coming into the
garden the very same boys who had
thrown stones at the Crow. They spread
a net on the ground and covered it with
very tasty bird seed then went away.</p>

<p>"These boys aren't so bad," said the
happy Canary, looking at the seeds.
"Look, Aunty, the boys have brought
me some food."</p>

<p>"Very fine food, I must say," croaked
the Crow. "Don't you dare stick your
bill in there! Do you hear me! If you
try to get that seed, you will be caught in
the net."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what will happen then?" asked
the Canary.</p>

<p>"Why, they will put you into a cage
again," said the Crow.</p>

<p>The Canary grew thoughtful. She
wanted food, but she did not want a cage.
Of course, it was cold and at times there
was little to eat. Still, life in freedom was
better, especially when it did not rain.
For several days the Canary was strong.
But hunger was stronger. Finally she
just had to yield to her longing for food.
She was caught in the net.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" piped the Canary pitifully.
"I will never do it again. It is
better to die of hunger than to live in a
cage."</p>

<p>The Canary now thought that there was
nothing in the whole world nicer than the
Crow's nest. Of course, it was cold and
occasionally one had no food. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127]</a></span>
was freedom. One could fly about wherever
one pleased. She wept, waiting for
the boys to come to put her into the cage.
But as luck would have it, the Crow
passed by that very moment and spied the
Canary in difficulty.</p>

<p>"You are foolish," scolded the Crow.
"Didn't I tell you not to touch those
seeds?"</p>

<p>"Aunty, I'll never do it again."</p>

<p>The Crow was just in time. The boys
were already on their way to fetch their
victim. The Crow tore the net quickly
with her beak. The Canary was free.</p>

<p>The boys chased the Crow, throwing
sticks and stones and scolding her for
some time.</p>

<p>"How nice it is to be free," chirped the
glad Canary, finding herself once more in
the Crow's nest.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's nice. You'd better take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128]</a></span>
care if you want to stay free," scolded the
Crow.</p>

<p>The Canary, safe in the Crow's nest,
started life anew. Never again did she
complain of either cold or hunger.</p>

<p>One day, the Crow flew away in search
of food and stayed all night in the field.
When she returned she found the little
Canary lying in the nest with her little legs
up&mdash;cold and stiff.</p>

<p>The Crow tilted her head to one side
and looking very closely at the Canary,
she said:</p>

<p>"Well, I told you you were not a real
bird."</p>

<h2>THE WISEST OF ALL</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t6"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>URKEY Gobbler awoke
as usual before any one else.
It was still dark. He woke up
his wife and said:</p>

<p>"Am I not the wisest of all?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130]</a></span>"</p>

<p>Turkey Hen was not quite awake. She
coughed and then answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very wise. Khe! Khe!
Khe! Who does not know that? Khe!
Khe! Khe!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't enough to say 'wisest of
all,'" said Turkey Gobbler. "There are
plenty of wise birds, but the wisest of all
is one, and that is I."</p>

<p>"The wisest of all! Khe! Khe! Khe!
The wisest of all! Khe! Khe! Khe!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>A little cross, Turkey Gobbler added in
a voice that other birds might hear:</p>

<p>"Do you know, I think that I am not
respected enough."</p>

<p>"You only imagine that. Khe! Khe!"</p>

<p>Turkey Hen calmed him, at the same
time smoothing her feathers that had
ruffled over night.</p>

<p>"You only think that, for one could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[ 131]</a></span>
imagine a wiser bird than you. Khe!
Khe!"</p>

<p>"What about the Gander? Oh, I see
everything. Of course, he is silent most of
the time, never saying anything directly,
but I feel that silently he does not respect
me."</p>

<p>"Don't pay any attention to him," said
Turkey Hen. "He isn't worth it. Khe!
Khe! Haven't you noticed how foolish
he is?"</p>

<p>"Any one can see that," said Turkey
Gobbler. "It is written all over his face,
'Foolish Gander,' and nothing else. But
it isn't really the Gander, for, after all, can
one be angry with a fool? The Rooster,
for instance. The most ordinary Rooster.
Did you hear him scream at me the other
day? He screamed so loudly that all the
neighbors heard him. It seemed to me he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132]</a></span>
was saying I was foolish or something like
that."</p>

<p>"How strange you are," said Turkey
Hen, astonished. "Don't you know why
Rooster screams?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>"Khe! Khe! Khe! It's very simple and
everybody knows it. You're a Cock and
he's a Cock. Only he is a very, very common
Cock, while you are a real beyond-the-sea
Indian Cock. That's why he
screams with envy. Every bird wishes to
be an Indian Cock. Khe! Khe!"</p>

<p>"But that's hard to be, mother. Ha!
ha! ha! Some ambition for a common
little Rooster to become a Turkey Gobbler!
No, sir. That never can be!" said
Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>Turkey Hen was a very modest, kind
bird. She was always worried when Turkey
Gobbler quarreled with anyone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133]</a></span></p>

<p>This morning, he was hardly awake
when he was thinking with whom to pick
a quarrel and fight. He was a restless
bird, though not unkind. Turkey Hen
was often hurt when other birds made
sport of Turkey Gobbler, calling him,
"Old Stuck-Up" or "Chatterbox" or
"Empty-Head." They were partly right,
of course. But then, there are no birds
without faults. That's why it is pleasant
to find in another bird even the tiniest
shortcomings.</p>

<p>The birds, now awakened, proceeded
from the poultry house into the barnyard,
and at once there arose a horrible clatter.
The hens made the most noise; they ran
around the yard, they climbed on the kitchen
windows, and they screamed, beside
themselves,</p>

<p>"Cut-a-cut! Cut-a-cut! Cut-a-cut!
We are hungry! Cook Matryona must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134]</a></span>
either be dead or she wants to starve us to
death."</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, have patience!"
remarked Gander, standing on
one leg. "Look at me. I, too, am hungry,
but I don't shout in the way you do. If I
were to open my mouth and scream,
'Quack! Quack!' or louder, 'QUACK!
QUACK! QUACK!'..."</p>

<p>Gander quacked so loudly that Cook
Matryona awakened immediately.</p>

<p>"It's easy for him to talk of patience,"
grumbled a Duck. "His throat is like a
megaphone. If I had a neck as long as
his, and a bill as strong as his, I'd also
preach patience. I would also have my
food before any one else, and preach patience
to the others. We know Master
Gander's patience."</p>

<p>Rooster, supporting Duck in this,
screamed, "Yes, it's easy for Gander to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135]</a></span>
talk of patience. Who pulled out two of
my finest tail feathers yesterday? It is dishonorable
to grab hold of a bird's tail. Of
course, we quarreled slightly and I won't
deny that I intended to pick Gander's
head, but then I was to blame, not my poor
tail. Am I not right, ladies and gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Hungry birds, like hungry people, become
unjust&mdash;just because they are
hungry.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t7"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>URKEY Gobbler, through
sheer pride, never scrambled
for food like other birds. He
always waited patiently for
Matryona to chase some
greedy bird away and to call him.</p>

<p>It was the same this morning. Turkey
Gobbler strutted along the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136]</a></span>
fence, pretending to be looking for something.</p>

<p>"Khe! Khe! I am so hungry," complained
Turkey Hen, stepping along behind
her husband. "Cook Matryona has
already strewn the oats and now, I think,
the leftover cereal of yesterday is coming.
Khe! Khe! Oh, how I do love cereal! I
think I could eat nothing but cereal the
rest of my life. I even dream of cereal
sometimes."</p>

<p>Turkey Hen liked to complain when
she was hungry and she demanded sympathy
from Turkey Gobbler. Compared
with other birds, she looked like an old
woman, humping her back and coughing.
She even walked with a broken gait, as if
her legs didn't belong to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be nice to have some
cereal," said Turkey Gobbler, agreeing
with her. "But a wise bird never scrambles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[ 137]</a></span>
for food. Am I not right? If my
master does not feed me, then I die of
hunger. Just let him find another Turkey
Gobbler like me!"</p>

<p>"There is not another like you," said
Turkey Hen.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said her husband.</p>

<p>"In reality, cereal is nothing. It is not
a question of cereal, but of Matryona.
Am I not right? As long as there is Matryona
there will be cereal. Everything in
the world depends upon Matryona&mdash;oats,
cereal, grains and crusts of bread."</p>

<p>In spite of these discussions, Turkey
Gobbler began to feel the pangs of hunger.
He became very sad indeed.</p>

<p>All the birds had been fed, and still
Matryona did not call him. Could she
have forgotten him? That would be no
joke.</p>

<p>Then something happened which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138]</a></span>
caused Turkey Gobbler to forget his
hunger.</p>

<p>A young hen, walking near the barn,
began to call, "Cut-a-cut! Cut-a-cut!
Cut-a-cut!" All the other hens took up the
call at once, screaming with all their
might, "Cut-a-cut! Cut-a-cut!" Loudest
of all was Rooster, of course, with his
"Cock-a-doodle-doo! Who's there?"</p>

<p>Attracted by the noise, all the birds ran
toward the barn. There they saw a most
unusual sight. Close to the barn, in a
hole, lay something gray and round and
all covered with sharp needles.</p>

<p>"Just an ordinary stone," said one.</p>

<p>"It's moving," exclaimed Little Hen.
"I also thought it was a stone, but it moved
when I came close, and it seems to me that
I saw eyes. Stones have no eyes, you
know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140]</a></span></p>


<p>"A foolish hen can see anything if she is
frightened," remarked Turkey Gobbler.
"Perhaps it ... it ..."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141]</a></span></p>

<p>He was interrupted by Gander, who
screamed:</p>

<p>"It's a mushroom. I have seen mushrooms
just like this, only they had no
needles."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed loudly at the
Gander.</p>

<p>"It looks more like a hat," someone ventured
to say, but this remark, too, met with
laughter.</p>

<p>"A hat has no eyes."</p>

<p>"Let us waste no time in empty conversation.
Let us act," decided the Rooster
for everybody. "Hey, you thing full of
needles, you speak for yourself! What
sort of beast are you? I like no fooling.
Do you hear?"</p>

<p>As there was no answer, the Rooster felt
insulted, and threw himself upon the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142]</a></span>
offender. He tried to peck him
once or twice but stepped aside, abashed.</p>

<p>"It is nothing but a huge pine cone," he
said. "Nothing tasty about it. Would
someone like to try?"</p>

<p>Everybody chattered, saying the first
thing that occurred to him.</p>

<p>There was no end to the different opinions.
Turkey Gobbler was the only silent
one. All the others chattered while he
listened to their foolishness. They clattered
and chattered for a long time, until
someone shouted:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, we are wasting
time, and needlessly tiring ourselves, when
we have Turkey Gobbler with us. He
knows everything."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed!" said Turkey Gobbler,
spreading his tail and puffing out his red
wattles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you do, then tell us who is this
strange creature."</p>

<p>"And if I don't want to tell you? Just
refuse to tell you?" said Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>Then all the birds began to beg him to
tell them.</p>

<p>"You are our wisest bird, Turkey Gobbler.
Please tell us. It will cost you nothing."</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler plumed himself for a
time and finally said:</p>

<p>"Very well. I will. Yes, I will tell you.
But first you must answer me&mdash;what do
you think of me?"</p>

<p>"Who doesn't know? You are the
wisest of all!" they answered in chorus.
"Isn't there a saying, 'As wise as a
Turkey?'"</p>

<p>"Then you do respect me?" asked Turkey
Gobbler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course we do. All of us respect
you."</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler plumed himself
some more, puffed up his red wattles,
strutted around the strange beast three
times and finally said:</p>

<p>"This is.... So you want to know
what this is?"</p>

<p>"We do! Please tell us! Don't torture
us any longer!" said the others.</p>

<p>"This ... but it is creeping!" said
Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>The fowls felt like laughing at him
when a giggle was heard and a thin little
voice said:</p>

<p>"There is the wisest bird of all! He!
He! He!" And from under the needles
appeared a black snout and two tiny black
eyes. The tiny black snout sniffed the air
and said:</p>

<p>"Hello, everybody! Is it possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[ 145]</a></span>
you do not recognize Porcupine&mdash;Porcupine
Gray? Pardon me ... but what a
funny Turkey Gobbler you have! I really
do not know how to say it politely ... but
your Turkey Gobbler is stupid."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-e1"><span class="dropcap">E</span></span>VERYBODY was horrified at
this insult that Porcupine
hurled at Turkey Gobbler. Of
course, Turkey Gobbler did
say a foolish thing just now,
but it does not mean that Porcupine has
any right to insult him.</p>

<p>It is very rude to enter a house and then
to insult the master. You must admit that
a Turkey Gobbler is a very dignified and
imposing bird. There is surely no comparison
between him and a Gray Porcupine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[ 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, everybody sided with Turkey
Gobbler and there arose a terrific clatter.</p>

<p>"Porcupine probably thinks that all of
us are foolish," said Rooster, flapping his
wings.</p>

<p>"He insulted all of us! If any one is
foolish, it is surely the Porcupine himself,"
said Gander, stretching his neck.
"I noticed that at once."</p>

<p>"How can mushrooms be foolish?"
answered Porcupine.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, we are wasting
time talking to him," shouted Rooster.
"He will not understand us, anyway. If,
instead, you, Mr. Gander, were to grab his
needles on one side, and Master Gobbler
and I on the other side, we would at once
know who is the wiser, for you cannot
hide brains under foolish needles."</p>

<p>"I am ready," replied Gander. "It
would be better still if I were to grab his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[ 147]</a></span>
needles in the back and you, Master
Rooster, pecked his snout. Then, ladies
and gentlemen, it will be seen who is the
wisest."</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler was silent all this time.
At first, he was overwhelmed by the Porcupine's
impudence and he did not know
what answer to make. Then Turkey Gobbler
grew so angry, so angry that he was
horrified at himself. His first wish was to
throw himself upon the offender and tear
him into tiny bits. Then would the world
see and be convinced what a strict and
serious bird a Turkey Gobbler is. He
even started in Porcupine's direction,
blowing himself up more and more, and
just as he was about to throw himself upon
Porcupine everybody began shouting and
scolding the stranger. Turkey Gobbler
stopped and waited patiently to see the end
of it all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148]</a></span></p>

<p>When Rooster suggested that they grab
Porcupine's needles and drag him in different
directions, Turkey Gobbler stopped
his ardor.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said he, "perhaps
all this can be settled amicably. Yes,
it seems to me there is a little misunderstanding
here. Leave the whole thing to
me."</p>

<p>"Very well. Let us wait," agreed the
Rooster, unwillingly. He was eager to
fight Porcupine. "I know nothing will
come of it."</p>

<p>"This is my affair," answered Turkey
Gobbler calmly. "Just stay around and
hear what I say."</p>

<p>All the birds formed a ring around Porcupine
and waited.</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler walked around the
stranger, coughed and said:</p>

<p>"Listen, Mr. Porcupine. Let us have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[ 149]</a></span>
serious explanation. In general, I do not
like domestic troubles."</p>

<p>"Heavens! How wise! How wise he
is!" thought Turkey Hen, listening to her
husband, silent with admiration.</p>

<p>"First of all, I want you to understand
that you are in respectable, well-behaved
society," said Turkey Gobbler, "and that
means something. Yes, you may consider
it an honor to get into our company."</p>

<p>"True! True!" shouted several.</p>

<p>"But this is between ourselves. The
main thing is not ..." here Turkey Gobbler
stopped, was silent a moment for better
effect, then continued, "Yes, the main
thing is&mdash;did you really think that we had
no idea what a Porcupine was? I have no
doubt that Gander was only joking when
he took you for a mushroom. And I can
say the same of what Rooster and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150]</a></span>
others said. Am I not right, ladies and
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"You certainly are, Turkey Gobbler,"
shouted the fowls in a voice so loud, that
poor Gray Porcupine tucked in her little
black snout.</p>

<p>"Oh, how wise he is!" thought Turkey
Hen, beginning to understand what her
husband was driving at.</p>

<p>"You see, Master Porcupine," continued
Turkey Gobbler, "we all like our
little jokes. I will not speak for myself.
Why not have a little joke? And as I see
it, you, Mr. Porcupine, seem also to be of
a merry disposition."</p>

<p>"And you guessed right," admitted
Porcupine, once more showing his little
black snout. "I have such a merry disposition
that I cannot sleep at night.
Many cannot stand that, but sleeping
bores me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[ 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will probably agree best with our
Rooster, who crows like mad all night,"
said Turkey Gobbler.</p>

<p>Everybody suddenly became gay. They
all felt Porcupine was there to complete
their happiness.</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler was triumphant at so
cleverly getting out of an awkward situation
caused by Porcupine's laughing in
his face and calling him stupid.</p>

<p>"Now Mr. Porcupine," said Turkey
Gobbler, winking, "confess that even
you were joking when you said that I was
not a wise bird."</p>

<p>"Of course, I was joking," said Porcupine,
reassuring him. "I have a merry
disposition. I love to joke."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I was quite sure of that.
Ladies and gentlemen, have you heard
him?" asked Turkey Gobbler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, we did. No one could
doubt it. He was joking."</p>

<p>Turkey Gobbler bent close to Porcupine's
ear and whispered:</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a horrible secret.
But only on one condition&mdash;don't breathe
it to a soul. It is true ... I am a little
ashamed to talk about myself ... but
how can I help it? I am the wisest bird!
At times, it even embarrasses me, but as
the wise Russians say, 'You can't hide an
awl in a sack.' Please not a word of this
to anyone!"</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF LITTLE MILK, LITTLE
CEREAL AND GRAY KITTEN, MOORKA</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-i3"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>T was wonderful. It was wonderful
that it happened every day. As
soon as Cook placed the pot of
milk and the earthenware oatmeal
pan upon the stove, it would all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[ 154]</a></span>
begin. At first, there was silence; then
conversation.</p>

<p>"I am Little Milk."</p>

<p>"And I am Little Cereal."</p>

<p>At first, conversation was carried on in
whispers.  But gradually both Little
Cereal and Little Milk would grow more
and more excited.</p>

<p>"I AM LITTLE MILK!"</p>

<p>"AND I AM LITTLE CEREAL!"</p>

<p>The cereal was generally covered with
an earthenware cover and she grumbled
away in her pot like an old woman. When
she grew angry, there came to the top a
bubble that burst and said:</p>

<p>"Still, I am Little Cereal. Puff!!"</p>

<p>This boasting was offensive to Little
Milk.</p>

<p>"My what a wonder! As if one had
never seen oatmeal cereal before!" and
Little Milk would grow more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[ 155]</a></span>
excited until rising to the top in a foam,
she tried to get out from the pot. No
sooner would Cook turn her head away
than Little Milk would run all over the hot
stove.</p>

<p>"Oh, this milk," complained Cook
every time it happened. "No sooner do I
take my eyes off it than it runs over."</p>

<p>"I can't help my fiery temper," would
reply Little Milk, defending herself. "It
doesn't make me happy to be angry and to
hear the boastings of Cereal, 'I'm Cereal!
I'm Cereal! I'm Cereal!' To see her sitting
there in her pan and grumbling
makes me angrier and angrier."</p>

<p>It happened sometimes that, in spite of
the cover, Little Cereal would escape from
her pan and creep along the stove, forever
repeating:</p>

<p>"I'm Cereal! I'm Cereal! I'm Cereal!
Z-h-h! Z-h-h!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[ 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, this did not happen every
day, but it did happen, and each time,
Cook in despair would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, this Cereal! It is amazing how it
will not stay in the pan."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-a2"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>S a rule, Cook was excited. Of
course, there were plenty of
reasons for her agitation. For
instance, there was Kitty
Moorka. He was a very
beautiful cat and Cook loved him very
much. In the morning, Moorka would
follow at the Cook's heels and meow so
pitifully that it would melt a heart of stone.</p>

<p>"Isn't your belly ever filled?" asked
Cook, astonished, chasing the cat. "Just
think of all that liver you ate last night."</p>

<p>"But that was yesterday," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[ 157]</a></span>
Moorka, astonished in his turn. "To-day,
I am hungry again. Meow."</p>

<p>"Why don't you catch mice if <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'your're'">you're</ins>
hungry? Lazy! That's what you are!"</p>

<p>"Talking is very easy. I'd like to see
you catch a mouse," Moorka defended
himself. "However, I always try hard.
Who caught a mouse last week? Who
had a scratch the full length of his nose?
That's the kind of rat I almost caught.
Then she grabbed hold of my nose. It's
easy to talk of catching mice. Indeed!"</p>

<p>After eating his liver, Moorka would
sit somewhere near the stove where it was
warm, close his eyes and doze sweetly.</p>

<p>"I hope you're full, now," said Cook.
"Even your eyes are squinting. Well, you
lie-on-your-side cat? Always meat, meat,
meat!"</p>

<p>"I'm no vegetarian, you know. I can
eat meat!" said Moorka, opening just one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158]</a></span>
eye. "You know I like fish too. It is
really pleasant to eat fish, and up to this
moment, I can't say which I like better,
liver or fish. Out of politeness, I like both.
If I were a man, I'd be either a fishman or
the butcher-boy who brings us the liver.
I'd feed all the cats from every corner of the
earth, and I myself would always have my
fill."</p>

<p>After eating, Moorka would grow interested
in things going on around him,
just by way of amusement. He would sit
on the window where the starling's cage
hung. It was pleasant to watch the foolish
bird, hopping back and forth.</p>

<p>"I know you, you old rascal!" the starling
would call to him. "You don't have
to be watching me!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would like to make your acquaintance,"
said Moorka.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know how you make friends,"
said the starling. "Didn't I see you eat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159]</a></span>
real live baby sparrow? You disgusting
brute!"</p>

<p>"I'm not at all disgusting. On the contrary,
everybody loves me," said Moorka.
"Come to me. I'll tell you a fairy tale."</p>

<p>"Oh, you rascal!" said the starling. "I
know what a fine story-teller you are.
Haven't I seen you tell stories to a roasted
spring chicken stolen from the kitchen? I
know you! You're a fine one!"</p>

<p>"Just as you like," said Moorka. "I
was thinking only of your pleasure. As
for that roasted spring chicken, I did eat
him. But anyhow, he wasn't good for anything
else."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-e2"><span class="dropcap">E</span></span>VERY morning, Moorka
would sit near the stove and
listen patiently to the quarreling
of Little Milk and Little
Cereal. He could never understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160]</a></span>
what it was all about and only
blinked his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am Little Milk!"</p>

<p>"I am Little Cereal! Cereal! Cereal!"</p>

<p>"I can't understand a word of it. No,
I don't understand it. Why are they
angry? If I were to repeat, 'I'm a Cat!
I'm a Cat! I'm a Cat!' could any one take
offense at it? I can't understand it at all.
However, I must confess I prefer Milk,
especially when she isn't angry."</p>

<p>When they quarreled, Little Cereal and
Little Milk would become so heated, they
ran all over the stove. Then there arose a
horrible smell. Cook would rush in,
wringing her hands, and crying:</p>

<p>"Whatever shall I do now? I can
never turn my head away without having
something happen."</p>

<p>Setting Milk and Cereal aside, Cook
went to market for provisions. Moorka
at once made the best of this. He sat down
close to Little Milk and said:</p>

<p>"Mistress Milk, please don't be angry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162]</a></span></p>


<p>Little Milk grew calmer as the cat
watched her. Moorka walked around the
spot several times, fixed his whiskers very
gently and said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen, folks! It isn't nice to quarrel.
Choose me for your judge and I'll settle
your affairs very quickly."</p>

<p>The black roach, sitting in the crack of
the wall, almost choked with laughter.</p>

<p>"A judge indeed! I must say! Ha!
Ha! Ha! It took you to think of it, you
old rascal."</p>

<p>But Little Milk and Little Cereal were
very glad to have someone settle their
quarrel at last, for they really did not
know why they were quarreling or what it
was all about.</p>

<p>"Very well. Very well. I'll unravel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164]</a></span>
this," said Kitty Moorka. "And I'll do it
honestly. Let us begin with Milk."</p>

<p>He walked around the pot several times,
touched Little Milk gently with his paw,
blew upon her again and started lapping
her up.</p>

<p>"Help Help!" shouted the black roach.
"He will lap up all the milk and I will be
blamed for it."</p>

<p>When Cook returned from market and
looked for the milk, the pot was empty.
Cat Moorka was sleeping sweetly near the
stove as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"You good-for-nothing!" scolded Cook,
pulling his ear. "Tell me, who drank the
milk?"</p>

<p>It was very painful, but Moorka pretended
not to understand anything. He
had suddenly become speechless! Then
he was thrown out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Behind the door, he shook himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165]</a></span>
smoothed his ruffled fur, curved his tail
and said:</p>

<p>"If I were Cook, all the cats would
drink milk day and night. However, I am
not angry with my Cook, because this is
something she can never really understand!"</p>

are smiling. They surround Verotchka's
little bed; they whisper and laugh in their
thin little voices.</p>

<p>There are crimson flowers, blue flowers,
yellow flowers, azure, pink, scarlet, white,
as if a rainbow, falling, struck the earth
and scattered its living sparks into many-colored
lights.</p>

<p>"Verotchka wants to be a Queen," gaily
proclaimed the Field Bluebells, swaying
on their thin, green stems.</p>

<p>"Oh, how comical she is!" whispered
the modest Forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, this affair needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168]</a></span>
serious discussion," said the yellow Dandelion
pertly.</p>

<p>"What does it mean to be a Queen?"
asked the blue Cornflower. "I grew up in
a field and I cannot understand your city
ways."</p>

<p>"It's very simple," said the pink Carnation.
"It is so simple it requires no explaining.
A Queen is ... is ... is....
You don't seem to understand....
How strange you are! A Queen is like a
flower, as pink as I am. In other words,
Verotchka wants to be a pink Carnation.
Isn't that simple?"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed gaily. Only the
Roses were silent. They were much
offended.</p>

<p>"Who doesn't know that the Queen of
Flowers is a Rose&mdash;delicate, fragrant,
marvellous? And suddenly a mere pink
Carnation calls herself a Queen. It's all
nonsense."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[ 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally one Rose grew angry and, turning
scarlet, she said: "Pardon me. Verotchka
wants to be a Rose. A Rose is the
Queen because everybody loves her."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is nice," said Dandelion,
growing angry. "If that's the case, where
do I come in?"</p>

<p>"Dandelion, please don't be angry,"
pleaded the Wood Bluebells. "It spoils
your temper and it is very ugly to be
angry. Look at us. We are silent, although
we know perfectly well Verotchka
wants to be a Wood Bluebell."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-t8"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HERE were many flowers and
they all talked calmly without
arguing.</p>

<p>All the field flowers, Lilies-of-the-Valley,
Violets, Forget-me-nots,
Bluebells, Cornflowers, Field
Clovers, were so very modest; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170]</a></span>
cultivated flowers, like the Roses, Tulips,
Lilies, Narcissuses, put on airs like rich
children in their Sunday clothes.</p>

<p>Verotchka loved the modest field
flowers best. Of these, she would make
wreaths and bouquets for the table. They
were all so nice.</p>

<p>"Verotchka loves us very much," whispered
the Violets. "We are the first to
arrive in spring. We come here as soon
as the snow melts."</p>

<p>"And we, too," said the Lilies-of-the-Valley.
"We are also spring flowers. We
are not exacting; we come direct from the
woods."</p>

<p>"It is not our fault that it is too cold for
us to grow in the fields," complained the
fragrant curly Stocks and Hyacinths.
"We are only visitors here. Our native
land is far away, in a warm country where
there is no winter. Oh, it is so nice there!
We are always longing for our native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171]</a></span>
land. Your north is so cold. Verotchka
loves us, and very much, too."</p>

<p>"It is also very nice here," argued the
Field Flowers. "Of course, it is very cold
at times, but it is healthy. The frost kills
our bitterest enemies, worms and bugs of
all kinds. If not for frost, life would be
very difficult."</p>

<p>"We also like cold," said the Roses.</p>

<p>The Azaleas and Camelias agreed with
this. They all liked the cold when they
were through blooming.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, let us talk about
our native countries," suggested White
Narcissus. "It will be so interesting.
Verotchka will listen, because she loves us
all."</p>

<p>Then they all talked together. Roses,
with tears, remembered the Vale of Shiraz
in Persia; the Hyacinths recalled Palestine;
the Azaleas, America; the Lilies,
Egypt; the flowers gathered there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172]</a></span>
from all corners of the earth and each one
could tell many wonderful stories. Most
of them came from the South, where there
is no winter and much sunshine.</p>

<p>There it is lovely&mdash;the summer is eternal.
The south is full of enormous trees,
wonderful birds, many butterflies, beauties,
resembling flying flowers, and
flowers resembling butterflies.</p>

<p>"We are only visitors here in the North.
At times, we feel very cold," whispered all
these southern flowers.</p>

<p>The native Field Flowers felt sorry for
them. Really, it must take a good deal of
patience to stand the cold north wind, the
cold rain and the falling snow. Of
course, the spring snow melts quickly, but
it is snow, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"You have one great fault," exclaimed
the Cornflower, after listening to all these
stories. "I don't deny you are, at times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173]</a></span>
more beautiful than we, simple Field
Flowers. I readily admit that, and then
you, too, you are our dear visitors, but
your main fault is that you grow only for
the few rich, while we grow for everybody.
In that we are kinder than you.
For example, look at me! You will find
me in the hands of every country child.
Just see how much pleasure I give to the
children of the poor! No one has to pay
money to buy me. It takes only a walk in
the woods to get me. I grow among the
wheat, the rye, and the oats."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-l3"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>ITTLE Verotchka listened
and wondered at these stories of
the flowers. She longed to see
everything for herself&mdash;all the
wonderful countries of which
the flowers spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I were only a Swallow I would fly
thither at once," said Verotchka. "Why
haven't I wings! Oh, it would be so nice
to be a bird!"</p>

<p>She had hardly finished speaking when
a little Lady Bug crept up to her,&mdash;a real
Lady Bug all red with tiny black spots, a
little black head, thin little black feelers
and thin little black legs.</p>

<p>"Let us fly, Verotchka," whispered
Lady Bug, twitching her feelers.</p>

<p>"But I have no wings, Lady Bug," said
Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Get on my back."</p>

<p>"How can I? You are so small, Lady
Bug."</p>

<p>"Just watch me," said Lady Bug.</p>

<p>Verotchka watched and wondered more
and more. Lady Bug stretched out her
strong upper wings and doubled in size;
then she opened her thin cobwebby lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175]</a></span>
wings and grew still larger. She grew
under Verotchka's very eyes and she became
so large&mdash;large enough for Verotchka
to sit comfortably upon her back
between her red wings.</p>

<p>"Are you comfortable, Verotchka?"
asked Lady Bug.</p>

<p>"Very," said Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Then hold on tight," said Lady Bug.</p>

<p>Then they flew. At first Verotchka was
afraid and closed her eyes. It seemed to
her that it was not she who was flying, but
as if cities, woods, rivers and mountains
were flying beneath her. Then it seemed
as if she had grown small&mdash;as small as a
pin head and as light as the down of Dandelion.</p>

<p>Lady Bug flew fast and faster, so fast
that the air whistled through her wings.</p>

<p>"Look down, Verotchka," said Lady
Bug.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Verotchka looked down and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, how many Roses&mdash;red, yellow,
white, pink," exclaimed Verotchka. The
world seemed to be covered with a carpet
of swaying Roses. "Let us descend," begged
Verotchka of the Lady Bug.</p>

<p>They descended and Verotchka grew
big again, as big as she was before, and
Lady Bug grew tiny again.</p>

<p>For a long time Verotchka ran about in
the rose-field and gathered a huge bunch
of Roses. How beautiful they were!
Their perfume made one faint. If one
could only carry the rose-field to the
North, where Roses were mere visitors!</p>

<p>"Now, let us go further," said Lady
Bug, stretching out her wings again.
Again, Lady Bug grew large and larger
and Verotchka grew small and smaller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[ 177]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-a3"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>GAIN they flew. It was all so
nice. Above, the sky so blue;
beneath, the water still bluer.
They flew over a steep rocky
shore.</p>

<p>"Will we really fly across the sea?"
asked Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Yes. But you must sit still and hold
me tight," said Lady Bug.</p>

<p>At first, Verotchka was afraid, but after
a while she wasn't. There was nothing
but sky and sea. On the sea sailed ships
like huge birds with white wings. The
little boats looked like flies.</p>

<p>Everything was lovely&mdash;so nice. Way
yonder was the shore, low, yellow, sandy.
It was the mouth of some huge river and
near it gleamed a city all white, as if built
of sugar. Still beyond, one saw a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178]</a></span>
desert, where stood the Pyramids. Lady
Bug descended upon the bank of the
river. Upon it grew tall Papyrus and
among them were Lilies, wonderful,
delicate.</p>

<p>"Your home is very lovely," said Verotchka
to the Lilies. "Does winter never
come here to you?"</p>

<p>"What is winter?" asked the Lilies,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Winter is the time snow falls," said
Verotchka.</p>

<p>"And what is snow?" asked the Lilies.</p>

<p>The Lilies even laughed at Verotchka.
They thought the little northern girl was
making fun of them. It is true that every
fall huge flocks of birds from the North
visited them and told them about the winter.
But these birds had never really seen
winter. They were only repeating what
they had heard and Verotchka could not
believe that there was no winter, for that
meant no need of warm coats or warm
shoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_187flying.png" width="400" height="558" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[ 180]</a></span></p>

<p>They flew further. Verotchka wondered
no longer at the blue sea, the mountains,
the sun-kissed desert and the Hyacinths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm too warm," complained Verotchka.
"You know, Lady Bug, I don't
think it's nice to have summer all the
time."</p>

<p>"It all depends upon what one is accustomed
to," said Lady Bug.</p>

<p>They flew towards high mountains, the
tops of which were always white with
snow. There it wasn't so warm. Beyond
the mountains, stretched deep, dark forests.
Under the forest trees, it was dark,
for the rays of the sun never penetrated
beyond the thick tree tops. Monkeys
swung from bough to bough. The woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182]</a></span>
were full of birds&mdash;green, yellow, blue.
But the most wonderful of all were the
flowers growing directly from the tree
trunks. There were flowers like fire,
flowers of all colors, flowers that looked
like birds and butterflies. The whole forest
seemed to blaze with many-colored
living fires.</p>

<p>"These are Orchids," explained Lady
Bug.</p>

<p>Here it was all a tangle. It was impossible
to walk.</p>

<p>They flew further. Beneath them, a
huge river spread between green banks.
Lady Bug alighted upon a huge white
flower that grew in the water. Verotchka
had never before seen a flower so large as
this.</p>

<p>"This is a holy flower," explained Lady
Bug. "It is called 'Lotus.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-l4"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>ITTLE Verotchka had seen
so much that she finally grew
tired and wanted to go home.
Home is best.</p>

<p>"I love white snow," said
Verotchka. "It isn't nice without winter."</p>

<p>Again they flew. The higher they flew,
the colder it grew. Soon there appeared
beneath them white fields and only the
pine woods were green. Verotchka was
so happy when she saw the first fir-tree.</p>

<p>"Little Fir-Tree! Little Fir-Tree!"
called Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Hello, Verotchka," answered the
Little Fir-Tree beneath her.</p>

<p>This was a real Christmas tree. Verotchka
knew her at once. That dear
Christmas tree! Verotchka bent down to
tell her how lovely she was and all of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184]</a></span>
sudden she felt herself going down, down,
down.</p>

<p>It was frightful. She turned somersaults
in the air several times, and then fell
right into the soft white snow. Verotchka
closed her eyes with fear and didn't know
whether she was dead or alive.</p>

<p>"How did you get here, Little One?"
asked somebody.</p>

<p>Verotchka opened her eyes and saw a
bent, old man, all gray. She knew him at
once. It was the same old man who
brought Christmas trees and golden stars,
boxes of candy and wonderful toys, to the
good children. He was so kind, this old
man; he picked her up in his arms and
covered her with his fur coat, asking her
again:</p>

<p>"How did you come here, Little Girl?"</p>

<p>"I travelled on Lady Bug's back, and I
saw so much, Grandfather!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"So, so."</p>

<p>"I know you, Grandfather. You bring
Christmas trees to children."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I'm fixing one now." And
he pointed to a tall pole that didn't look
like a Christmas tree at all.</p>

<p>"What sort of Christmas tree is that,
Grandfather? It's nothing but a long
stick."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," said Grandfather.</p>

<p>Grandfather carried Verotchka into a
tiny village almost buried in snow. Only
the roofs and chimneys were visible. The
country children were all waiting for the
old grandfather. They jumped and
shouted, when they saw him.</p>

<p>"Christmas tree! Christmas tree!"</p>

<p>They came to the first hut. Grandfather
got an unbroken sheaf of oats, tied
it to the end of the pole and stuck the pole
on the roof. Immediately the tiny birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186]</a></span>
that do not go away for the winter flew
upon it from all sides and began pecking
the seeds.</p>

<p>"It is our Christmas tree," they shouted.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Verotchka felt very happy.
That was the first time she had seen a
Christmas tree made for the winter birds.</p>

<p>"What a kind old grandfather!"</p>

<p>One little Sparrow, bustling about more
than the others, recognized Verotchka
and called out!</p>

<p>"Why, this is Verotchka! I know her
very well. Many, many times has she
scattered crumbs for me."</p>

<p>Other Sparrows also recognized her
and piped noisily with joy.</p>

<p>Then came another Sparrow that
turned out to be the squabbler. He began
pushing everybody aside and snatching
the best seeds. This was the same Sparrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187]</a></span>
who had quarreled with Stickelback.
Verotchka knew him at once.</p>

<p>"Hello, Master Sparrow!" she said.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Verotchka? Why, hello!"</p>

<p>Sparrow Squabbler hopped on one leg,
winked knowingly with one eye and said
to the old man:</p>

<p>"Why, this is Verotchka, who wants to
be the Queen. I myself heard her say
that."</p>

<p>"Do you want to be a Queen, Little
One?" asked the Old Man.</p>

<p>"Yes, very much, Grandfather," said
Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the wise old man.
"There is nothing simpler. Every Queen
is a woman and every woman a Queen.
Now go home and tell that to all the other
little girls."</p>

<p>Lady Bug was very glad to get away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188]</a></span>
She was afraid that the quarrelsome Sparrow
would gobble her up.</p>

<p>So Verotchka and Lady Bug flew home.
Faster and faster they flew. At home, all
the flowers were waiting for Verotchka.
They had been wondering what is a Queen
all the time she was away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="txtidt"><span class="dcp-l5"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>ULLA-LULLABY. Verotchka's
one eye is sleeping; the other
little eye is open. Verotchka's
one little ear is sleeping; the
other ear listens.</p>

<p>Now everybody gathered about Verotchka's
bed. Bold Rabbit, Bear Mishka,
Squabbling Rooster and Sparrow, Black-headed
Crow, Stickelback and tiny, tiny
Cacinella. They were all there near Verotchka.</p>

<p>"Father, I love them all," whispered
Verotchka. "I love even the Black
Roach, Father."</p>

<p>Verotchka's other eye is asleep. The
other little ear is also asleep. Near Verotchka's
bed, the green spring grass grows
gaily, the flowers are smiling&mdash;many
flowers, blue, pink, yellow, azure and
scarlet. The green birch bends over Verotchka's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190]</a></span>
bed and whispers something, lovingly.</p>

<p>The sun is shining, the sand is yellow,
and the blue sea waves beckon to Verotchka
to come to them.</p>

<p>Sleep, Verotchka, and grow strong!</p>

<p>Lulla-Lullaby.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
